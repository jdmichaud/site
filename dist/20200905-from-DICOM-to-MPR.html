  <h3 class="title">From DICOM to MPR (part 1)</h3>
  <p>
    This is the first part of 5 parts series. Link to <a href="blog-entry.html?article=20200912-from-DICOM-to-MPR-part2.html" class="visible-link">part 2</a>.

    In this series of articles, we will review some obscure piece of technology
    that you probably never heard of but which may have saved your life at some
    point. We will cover a little of history, do some math and, most
    importantly, have fun !

    Medical imaging is a pretty old field of science that was kick-started more than 120 years
    ago when Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen <a href="https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Radiography/Introduction/history.htm" class="visible-link">
    accidentally took the first radiography of his hand</a>.
    He just discovered X-rays, a electromagnetic radiation which is sufficiently
    energetic to go through, with varying degree of efficiency, most of the human
    tissues. Although the term x-ray seems mysterious, there is nothing particular
    to them compared to other radiations with different energy levels. The spectrum
    of electromagnetic radiation also contains visible light, ultra-violet,
    infra red, gamma rays, radio waves or micro waves. The difference between those different "rays" or "waves" are
    just their frequency which is inversely proportional to their energy level.
    The more energetic a ray is, the more chance there is for the ray to be able
    to go through matter (which happens to be mostly empty space). Visible light
    for example is not able to go through your body, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_and_Alexander#The_original_anecdote" class="visible-link">
    Diogenes reminded Alexander the great</a>,
    but x-rays can. In turn, x-rays can't go though thick sheets of lead for example, which
    is why this material is most often used for shielding.

    One of the problem of medicine is to be able to properly diagnose a patient
    ailment. Contrary to a mechanic, a doctor can't just open a patient just
    for the sake of analysis as it entails a lot of risk. The discovery of the
    ability to take photos of the inside of a patient body using those newly
    discovered x-rays was a huge step in medical diagnostic. Now you could
    properly observe a fracture or see the evolution of a lung disease. Medical
    imaging became a very important field of medicine and throughout the years
    have seen tremendous amount of innovation. Today, the 2 dimensional nature
    of the early radiography have been complemented by a third dimension either
    of time or space or even a fourth for multi-phase computed tomography images.
    X-rays can be generated in real-time in order to help doctor operate a
    patient <a href="https://youtu.be/O5IwNioRkh0?t=22" class="visible-link">without even opening him</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Indeed, one of the problem of
    x-rays is that they are dangerous. Due to their high energy level, they can
    ionize particles and modify the chemical properties of atoms. As a
    consequence they can break down DNA or, even worst, kill cells, which leads
    to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation-induced_cancer#Medical" class="visible-link">
    pretty nasty consequences</a> when
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25" class="visible-link">
    their emissions are not properly controlled</a>.
    Each time a doctor requests a CT exam, he is taking a risk. He has to weight
    the benefit of exposing his patient to dangerous ionizing rays versus the risk
    of not knowing exactly what is wrong with him. But fret not! X-rays are not
    the only mean to this end. Other type of medical imaging exists that are not
    inherently dangerous like Magnetic Resonance and Ultrasound.

    The combination of technology and outcome is called a modality. A CT scanner
    is a modality different from an MR scanner which itself is different from a
    US probe. And all these modalities will be used to diagnose different types
    of problems. The machine making up those modalities generate images that will
    then be used by doctors to diagnose and choose the best possible treatment.
    But how does those images get from the machine to the doctors eyes?
    Initially, radiography would be imprinted on a photographic film and
    would be reviewed directly by doctors. Storage was physical and the only
    way to see the image was to having it carried around physically. Various form
    of physical media were used up to a point were scanners and probes started to
    emit digital data. At that point, those images could finally be transmitted
    logically, copied, stored at different places and more importantly reviewed
    on a screen where image manipulation could enhance their diagnostic value. The
    screen on which doctors could see those images belongs to specific workstation
    purposefully build to review the medical images being generated.
  </p>

    There was one problem though. Multiple manufacturers competed on the medical
    imaging markets (mainly General Electric, Siemens, Philips and Toshiba) and
    none of them would produce medical images in the same way. As a consequence
    an image from a Toshiba scanner could not be read by a Siemens machine.
    In 1982, The American College of Radiology (ARC) and the National Electrical
    Manufacturers Association got together and decided to <a href="http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/2016b/output/chtml/part01/sect_1.3.html" class="visible-link">
    "specify a hardware interface, a minimum set of software commands, and a
    consistent set of data formats"</a> which would allow interoperability between
    systems and a few years later in 1993, the ARC-NEMA standard was renamed
    Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM).

  <p>
    In the later parts of this series we will talk about the DICOM format in
    more detail and the way images are to be stored and processed in order to be
    useful (<a href="/blog/blog-entry.html?article=20200912-from-DICOM-to-MPR-part2.html" class="visible-link">part 2</a>)
    and we will dive into the nitty-gritty of how the information should be
    interpreted so that images come alive (part 3) and finally we will write a
    small algorithm which will allow us to render a Multiplanar Reformation
    (MPR) image. Stay tuned !
