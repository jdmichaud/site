  <h2 class="title">Use DWARF to debug WASM in the browser (part 1)</h2>
  <h3>The DWARF standard and how to extract information for fun and profit</h3>
  <p>
    In our <a class="visible-link" href=blog-entry.html?article=20220821-how-to-debug-wasm-in-firefox.html>previous article</a>
    we have seen how WASM files were structured in sections and how to extract
    them. In this article, we will go a little deeper into what DWARF is and how
    it is encoded in the WASM file.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a class="visible-link" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWARF>DWARF</a>
    is a standard describing how debugging symbol must be written in order for a
    debugger to help get insight into how a computer is executing a program. It
    describes the relationship between machine instruction and original code (as
    written in the programming language used to produce the program), how the
    code is structured, how the variables are stored etc. It's present in any
    <a class="visible-link" href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/ELF_Executable_and_Linkable_Format_diagram_by_Ange_Albertini.png>ELF executables</a>
    that was build with debug symbols with a modern tool. I will not go into the
    historical details of DWARF as you can already find a nice introduction in
    <a class="visible-link" href=https://dwarfstd.org/doc/Debugging%20using%20DWARF-2012.pdf>Micheal Eager's introduction</a>
    which goes into the when and why. We will focus here on how DWARF is encoded
    in the WASM file and how we can extract useful data for debugging. The final
    authority on everything DWARF is the DWARF Debugging Information Format
    Committee. Their output is <a class="visible-link" href=https://dwarfstd.org/doc/DWARF4.pdf>a precious document</a>
    that I have been referring to a lot. This is for version 4 of DWARF. The
    <a class="visible-link" href=https://dwarfstd.org/doc/DWARF5.pdf>latest version is 5</a> but, at the time
    of this writing, it is still not widely supported and you have more chance
    to encounter DWARF4 in the wild than DWARF5. Anyway both are pretty close
    and I guess knowing version 4 will already bring a long way to master
    version 5.
  </p>
  <p>
    I shall point out that, in the process of understanding DWARF, in addition
    to the aforementioned wiki page and documentation, I also use <a class="visible-link" href=https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/6072226/lib/std/dwarf.zig>zig source code</a>
    which was a huge help to get me out of local minimum of understanding I was
    left by the official documentation which is, nevertheless, very complete.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you delve into the DWARF format/standard it is important to keep in mind
    that one of the main design goal of DWARF is to consume as little as
    possible of space. A lot of the design decisions made by the standard
    only make sense if you realize that every byte saved counts.
  </p>
  <h3>Example project</h3>
  <p>
    In order to follow the example, you can produce a simple WASM file using the
    zig compiler. Create the file called <i>add.zig</i>:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="C">
    const std = @import("std");

    export fn add(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {
      return a + b;
    }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    And compile it with:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="bash">
    zig build-lib add.zig -target wasm32-freestanding -dynamic
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    You can then have a look at the DWARF symbol with the <b>dwarfdump</b> tool with:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="bash">
    dwarfdump -debug-info -debug-line --recurse-depth=0 add.wasm
  </code></pre>
  <h3>DWARF sections</h3>
  <p>
    As we have see in the <a class="visible-link" href=blog-entry.html?article=20220821-how-to-debug-wasm-in-firefox.html>previous article</a>,
    a WASM file is made of sections. Below are the sections of a simple wasm file:
  </p>
  <pre>
      type starts=0x0000000a size=0xc
  function starts=0x00000018 size=0x3
     table starts=0x0000001d size=0x5
    memory starts=0x00000024 size=0x3
    global starts=0x00000029 size=0x8
    export starts=0x00000033 size=0x10
      code starts=0x00000046 size=0xd9
      data starts=0x00000121 size=0x24
    custom starts=0x00000148 size=0x58d   .debug_info
    custom starts=0x000006d8 size=0x295   .debug_pubtypes
    custom starts=0x0000096f size=0x28    .debug_loc
    custom starts=0x00000999 size=0x26    .debug_ranges
    custom starts=0x000009c2 size=0x175   .debug_abbrev
    custom starts=0x00000b3a size=0x12e   .debug_line
    custom starts=0x00000c6b size=0x54b   .debug_str
    custom starts=0x000011b9 size=0x43c   .debug_pubnames
    custom starts=0x000015f7 size=0x48    name
    custom starts=0x00001641 size=0x1a    producers
  </pre>
  <p>
    Each line here is a section. Each section starts somewhere in the binary
    file and have a size. Their type is the first byte of the section. The first
    sections are the WASM sections. Each have their special meaning and
    purposes. In our example, after the data section come the custom sections.
    Each of these custom sections have names which identify their purposes. As
    you can see, several of them starts with <b>.debug</b>. These are the DWARF
    sections.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will not go into the details of all those sections but we will focus
    particularly on:
    <ul>
      <li><b>.debug_str</b>:
      this sections is fairly simple. It is a concatenation of zero-terminated
      strings. It is used by DWARF as a store for identifiers and will be
      pointed to by reference by other sections, especially .debug_info.</li>
      <li><b>.debug_abbrev</b>:
      Described in chapter 7.5.3 of the information format document, the
      abbreviation table is one of the cost cutting measure used to ensure the
      lowest possible redundancy in the data stored in the custom sections. This
      section contains a dictionary of structure definition used in the
      .debug_info section. Basically a list of identifiers for which is
      associated a list of tags/values representing field names and their type.
      </li>
      <li><b>.debug_line</b>:
      Described in chapter 6.2 of the information format document, this section
      is pretty wild. It basically contains a program for a state machine to
      reconstruct a correspondence between the original source code and the
      machine instructions present in the executable. It's sound scary but its
      manageable.
      </li>
      <li><b>.debug_info</b>:
      Described in chapter 7.5 (alongside the abbreviation table), the
      .debug_info section is the main course of the DWARF meal. This is where
      you will extract the "Debug Information Entries" or DIEs which are data
      structure describing the various debug symbols.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h4>Debug Information Entries</h4>
  <p>
    Debug information entries (DIE) are important data structures in the DWARF
    standard. Each DIE is a node of a tree of DIEs. As described by the standard:
    <pre><i>
      A variety of needs can be met by permitting a single debugging information
      entry to “own” an arbitrary number of other debugging entries and by
      permitting the same debugging information entry to be one of many owned by
      another debugging information entry. This makes it possible, for example,
      to describe the static block structure within a source file, to show the
      members of a structure, union, or class, and to associate declarations
      with source files or source files with shared objects.
    </i></pre>
    So DIEs are the alpha and omega of the DWARF symbols. They are present in
    the <b>.debug_info</b> sections and represent everything that you can find
    in a program: compilation units (files), variables, functions, enum members,
    etc. They are arranged as a tree and each of them has a type. The type will
    correspond to a data structure described in the abbreviation table.
  </p>
  <pre>
0x000000f5:   DW_TAG_variable
                DW_AT_name      ("os")
                DW_AT_type      (0x00000104 "std.target.Target.Os")
                DW_AT_decl_file ("/path/to/builtin.zig")
                DW_AT_decl_line (18)
                DW_AT_linkage_name      ("os")
  </pre>
  <p>
    For example, this is a DIE as represented by the <b>dwarfdump</b> tool. We
    can see that this DIE is a variable of type <i>std.target.Target.Os</i> (the
    language is zig here). We can see the location of its declaration and its
    name.
  </p>
  <p>
    For our purpose, the DIE we will mainly focus on is the
    <i>DW_TAG_compile_unit</i>. A compilation unit (cu) is a source file. And if
    we want to extract sourcemap information, files are at the basis of our
    analysis.
  </p>
  <h4>Deep dive in the .debug_info and .debug_abbrev section</h4>
  <p>
    Let's have look at how the <b>.debug_info</b> and <b>.debug_abbrev</b>
    section look like:
  </p>
  <pre>
    00 8D 0B  0B 2E 64 65  62 75 67 5F  69 6E 66 6F  7D 05 00 00  04 00 00 00  00 00 04 01
    ^^ ^^^^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^
    ID 0x58D  11  .  d  e   b  u  g  _   i  n  f  o  unit length  v4 offset ab table sz AC
  </pre>
  <p>
    In the previous section we've seen how a custom section header is decoded.
    Immediately following the header, we will find the root node of our DIE tree
    which is a compilation unit. Indeed, at the top of the source code hierarchy
    is the source file... It starts with the CU's length, here 0x57D. Then the
    DWARF version on 2 bytes followed by the offset in the abbreviation table.
    This will be use to seek, in the abbreviation table, the information related
    to the structure of this CU. Then on one byte we get the size of the address
    (sz) on the target machine. This is not useful for us now, let's just ignore
    it. Finally, we find the abbreviation code (AC) of the root DIE of this CU.
  </p>
  <p>
    So let's have a look at how this abbreviation code finds its meaning in the
    abbreviation table. Here is the content of the .debug_abbrev:
  </p>
  <pre>
    00  F5 02 0D 2E  64 65 62 75  67 5F 61 62  62 72 65 76  01 11 01 25  0E [.. ..] 55 17  00 00
    ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^                       ^^ ^^
    ID  0x175 13  .   d  e  b  u   g  _  a  b   b  r  e  v  AC TG CH                        END
  </pre>
  <p>
    Here, the first abbreviation code is 0x01, right after the custom section
    name. So as promised by the information we got from the .debug_info section,
    at offset 0x0000 of the <b>.debug_abbrev</b> section we get the information
    for the abbreviation code 0x01 (AC). Following the code we get the Tag (TG).
    In the standard, chapter 7.5.4 Figure 18 we get the meaning of this tag:
  </p>
  <pre>
    DW_TAG_Compilation_Unit............ 0x11
  </pre>
  <p>
    No surprise there, the first DIE (the root) is a compilation unit. After the
    tag comes one byte indicating if this DIE has children or not (CH). As
    explained above, DIE are arranged as a tree. A node DIE has children and a
    LEAF die doesn't (like a variable for example). Here, our CU has children,
    which is expected unless the source file was empty... Then, after the
    children byte comes a series of attribute specification. Each specification
    is a tuple of unsigned LEB128 which represent the name and type of the
    attribute. The list is terminated by two 0x00 bytes. In our case, the CU
    will be represented this way:
  </p>
  <pre>
0x0000000b: DW_TAG_compile_unit
              DW_AT_producer    ("zig 0.10.0")
              DW_AT_language    (DW_LANG_C99)
              DW_AT_name        ("main")
              DW_AT_stmt_list   (0x00000000)
              DW_AT_comp_dir    (".")
              DW_AT_GNU_pubnames        (true)
              DW_AT_low_pc      (0x00000000)
              DW_AT_ranges      (0x00000000
                 [0x00000002, 0x0000002e)
                 [0x00000030, 0x000000d9))
  </pre>
  <p>
    So to come back to our abbreviation table, right after the children byte
    came 0x25. And looking at the attribute encoding (Figure 20 of the same
    chapter) we see that:
  </p>
  <pre>
    DW_AT_producer............ 0x24
  </pre>
  <p>
    0x0E corresponds to the type of the field which, according to Figure 21 of
    the same chapter is:
  </p>
  <pre>
    DW_FORM_strp............ 0x0E
  </pre>
  <p>
    The type DW_FORM_strp indicates a string that must be found in the
    <b>.debug_str</b> section. In order to know where, we must go back to the
    <b>.debug_info</b> section which contains the actual value of the field:
  </p>
  <pre>
    01  33 05 00 00  0C 00 65 01
    ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^
    AC  offset in .debug_str
  </pre>
  <p>
    What the DW_FORM_strp definition (7.5.4 Attribute Encodings) tells us is
    that the next 4 bytes will get us an offset in the <b>.debug_str</b>
    section. And sure enough, at this offset we will find: "zig 0.10.0".
  </p>
  <h4>A word on the tree structure</h4>
  <p>
    Remember that we said the DIE where structured as a tree? How does this tree
    is represented? Well, the children byte will indicate if the DIE has
    children. If it doesn't, then when reading the next DIE we can consider that
    it will be the sibling of the DIE we just read. If it has children, all the
    following DIE will be considered the children of the DIE we just read unless
    a 0x00 is encountered for an abbreviation code. In that case, we consider
    than the list of children of the parent DIE is finished. So, if we were to
    represent a DIE with an abbreviation code of 0x05 and with children this
    way: 0x05(1), then if we were to read a .debug_info structure this way:
  </p>
  <pre>
    0x04(1) 0x12(0) 0x08(1) 0xD1(0) 0x22(0) 0x00 0x0A(0) 0x00
  </pre>
  <p>
    We could conclude that the tree should look like this:
  </p>
  <pre>
    0x04
    ├─0x12
    ├─0x08
    │  ├─0xD1
    │  └─0x22
    └─0x0A
  </pre>
  <h3>Enough for today!</h3>
  <p>
    Phew, that was a big one. No need to decode the entire sections for us to
    get the gist of it. With some back and forth between the .debug_info section
    which gives us the structure of the tree and the data of the DIE and the
    .debug_abbrev section which gives us the structure of the DIE, we can
    reconstruct our DWARF data structure, which, for our example, would look like
    this:
  </p>
  <pre>
0x0000000b: DW_TAG_compile_unit
              DW_AT_producer    ("zig 0.10.0")

              DW_AT_ranges      (0x00000000
                 [0x00000002, 0x0000002e)
                 [0x00000030, 0x000000d9))
