  <h3 class="title">A personal tech blog. Why?</h3>
  <p>
    I have been thinking of creating a technical blog for a while now. I was not
    sure of what kind of content I would create. I doubted I could create
    something original or even interesting and I doubted even more it could be
    of any interest for anyone. Then I realized that this blog could always be
    useful for at least one reader: me.
  </p>
  <p>
    The technological world is quickly evolving. Gone are the simple times when
    knowing a bit of electronics, a bit of BASIC and the 6502 datasheet could
    help you create a company or at least make a decent living. For the last 30
    years the amount of knowledge attached to computer engineering has exploded
    and it's getting harder to keep up. Abstractions after abstractions are
    being layered on top of what was an already challenging knowledge field.
    Today's engineer should know about programming languages, tools, software
    patterns, basic maths and methodologies. They should keep an eye on emerging
    technologies as well as keep an interests in older (event sometimes extinct)
    ones. They should know about their business domain knowledge too, which in
    itself is a challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's the reason that finally got me to spend some time on this. My memory
    is limited. Very limited. I stupidly pride myself of having a poor memory
    and try to compensate with all sorts of tricks, one of them being this blog.
    In the months to come I will try to write all those articles I have been
    thinking about which will help me sort and clarify my thoughts and keep a
    track of them. "Whatever we conceive well we express clearly".

    This blog was inspired by <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/"
    class="visible-link"> Fabien Sanglard's Website</a>. A great developer blog
    with a simple design which convey its deeply researched content clearly and
    without fuss. I took it as a model.
