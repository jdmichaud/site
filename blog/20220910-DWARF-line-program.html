  <h2>Use DWARF to debug WASM in the browser (part 2)</h2>
  <h3>Read line number data from the DWARF symbol</h3>
  <p>
    <a class="visible-link"
    href=blog-entry.html?article=20220903-DWARF-overview.html>In the previous
    articles</a> we have extracted the debug sections of the WASM binary and
    started interpreting the DWARF data in them. We extracted the compilation
    unit and the associated Debug Information Entry (DIE).
  </p>
  <p>
    In this article, we will see how we can interpret the data present in the
    <b>.debug_line</b> section. It is important to keep in mind that using as
    little space as possible is one of the main design goal of DWARF. That is
    why the way the association between the source location and the compiled
    code is encoded the way it is in DWARF. In order, for your debugger, to know
    where in the code the current program counter register points to, a
    correspondence between the instruction address and the source location must
    be encoded in the <b>.debug_line</b>. The data is not encoded using what we
    might call a format. It is actually encoded as a program. We will create a
    virtual machine composed of various register and read binary code which
    represent instructions, each of those instruction acting on the state of the
    virtual machine register. Occasionally, this VM will generate an entry in a
    matrix that will match instruction code of the original compiled program to
    the corresponding source location.
  </p>
  <h3>The line program virtual machine</h3>
  <p>
    The virtual machine is composed of the following "registers":
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>address</b>: The program counter value for a particular instruction in
      the original program.</li>
      <li><b>op_index</b>: This is related to VLIW architecture, not relevant in the
      WASM context.</li>
      <li><b>file</b>: An index in a filename array.</li>
      <li><b>line</b>: The line in the source file.</li>
      <li><b>column</b>: The column in the source file.</li>
      <li><b>is_stmt</b>: A boolean indicating if the instruction can be used as a
      breakpoint or not.</li>
      <li><b>basic_block</b>: Indicating if the instruction is the first of a basic
      block. A basic block being more or less a function.</li>
      <li><b>end_sequence</b>: A sequence is a contiguous set of instruction. This
      boolean indicate the instruction is the last of the sequence.</li>
      <li><b>prologue_end</b>: A boolean indicating that the current instruction is
      at the beginning of a function. A breakpoint here will stop right before
      the actual code of the function runs.</li>
      <li><b>epilogue_begin</b>: A boolean indicating the contrary. An instruction
      executed after the function has finished and right before it returns.</li>
      <li><b>isa</b>: Not important in the WASM context.</li>
      <li><b>discriminator</b>: An index indicating the if of the block the
      instruction belongs to.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    They are described in details in <a class="visible-link"
    href=https://dwarfstd.org/doc/DWARF4.pdf>DWARF Debugging Information Format
    version 4 chapter 6.2.2</a>.
    The whole purpose of the program will be to change the virtual machine state
    and generate a correspondence matrix using those registers. Every once in a
    while, the registers will be dumped in a stack and this will identify another
    link between the instructions and the source program.
  </p>
  <h3>The line program instructions</h3>
  <p>
    This virtual machine will read its instruction from the <b>.debug_line</b>
    section. The instruction set is pretty simple. I will not list them all here
    as you can find them in Chapter 6.2.5 of the aforementioned document. The
    instructions are of 3 different types:
    <ul>
      <li>1. The standard opcode: They will act on the register in various ways.
      depending on the version of the DWARF standard, their number is pretty
      limited. 12 for version 4. They can have operands.</li>
      <li>2. The extended opcode: Not much different from the standard opcodes,
      there's four of them in version 4.</li>
      <li>3. The special opcode: Their only purpose is to advance the VM address
      register by the value depending on their opcode and a pretty involved
      formula described in chapter 6.2.5.1. Another cost saving measure.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h4>The special opcodes</h4>
  <p>
    They are only represented by their opcode as an unsigned byte. They have no
    operands. Each time a special opcode is read, the VM will create an entry
    in the correspondence matrix. The opcode will also have some effect on the
    VM state <a class="visible-link" href=https://dwarfstd.org/doc/DWARF4.pdf>see 6.2.5.1.</a>.
  </p>
  <h4>The standard opcodes</h4>
  <p>
    As we have seen, there are twelve of them. Their opcode is represented by
    an unsigned byte. The opcode can be followed by zero, one or multiple
    operands encoded in LEB128. One example of instruction is
    <b>DW_LNS_advance_line</b> which opcode is 0x0C and takes one LEB128 operand
    which must be added to the line register of the VM.
  </p>
  <h4>The extended opcode</h4>
  <p>
    The extended opcode have their first byte set to 0 and their opcode,
    starting on the second byte is encoded in LEB128. There are 4 described in
    the version 4 of the standard but due to their encoding they can be many
    future extension without breaking backward compatibility.
  </p>
  <h3>The <b>.debug_line</b> section</h3>
  <p>
    Like the custom sections we have covered in the previous article, the
    <b>.debug_line</b> section first starts with 0x00, the length of the
    section, the length of the section name and finally the name. The next byte
    will correspond to index 0x00 of the line program header. This is important
    because each compilation unit has a field called DW_AT_stmt_list which is
    one of the tags we read when we decoded the CU.
  <pre>
0x0000000b: DW_TAG_compile_unit
            DW_AT_producer    ("zig 0.10.0")
            DW_AT_language    (DW_LANG_C99)
            DW_AT_name        ("main")
            DW_AT_stmt_list   (0x00000000)  <----- here
            DW_AT_comp_dir    (".")
            DW_AT_GNU_pubnames        (true)
            DW_AT_low_pc      (0x00000000)
            DW_AT_ranges      (0x00000000
               [0x00000003, 0x000000d5)
               [0x000000d6, 0x000000de))
  </pre>
    This field will reference an offset in the .debug_line section indicating
    the start of the line program corresponding to the CU. The offset starts
    right after the section name.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our example here, the statement list starts at 0x00. The first thing we
    will read is the line program header. The header determine some parameters
    and the initial state of the VM. The header is composed as follow:
    <ul>
      <li><b>unit_length</b> (4 bytes): The size of the program to come.</li>
      <li><b>version</b> (2 bytes): The version which depends on the DWARF
      version. Can probably be ignored.</li>
      <li><b>header_length</b> (4 bytes): The size of this header up to the
      first instruction.</li>
      <li><b>minimum_instruction_length</b> (1 byte): Parameter which will be used by
      the instructions to come.</li>
      <li><b>maximum_operations_per_instruction</b> (1 bytes): Ditto.</li>
      <li><b>default_is_stmt</b> (1 byte): The value to which initialize the
      VM's <b>is_stmt</b> register.</li>
      <li><b>line_base</b> (1 byte signed!)</li>
      <li><b>line_range</b> (1 byte): Both line_base and line_range will be use to
      calculate a state change in the VM depending on the opcode value.</li>
      <li><b>opcode_base</b> (1 byte): The number assigned to the first special
      opcode.</li>
      <li><b>standard_opcode_lengths</b>: This is an array of LEB128, one for each
      standard opcode which gives the number of operands for each opcode. The
      first LEB128 is for opcode 1, the second opcode 2, etc. until
      opcode_base - 1</li>
      <li><b>include_directories</b>: A sequence of zero-terminated strings which
      ends with two zeros. Will be used to reconstruct full file path.</li>
      <li><b>file_names</b>: A sequence of records whose indices in the
      sequence are used in the VM register "file". It is to be noted that the
      sequence starts with index 1.</li>
    </ul>
    Once the line header is read, the instruction starts. The instructions
    will be read opcode by opcode. Either the opcode found is zero and then
    the extended opcode will be read in the following LEB128, either the value
    is below the opcode_base value and is considered a standard opcode whose
    description can be found in <a class="visible-link" href=https://dwarfstd.org/doc/DWARF4.pdf>6.2.5.2</a>,
    either it is a special opcode.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reading this code until the end of the unit (whose length is given in the
    header) will ensure the VM state is changed appropriately and the
    correspondence is generated. You will end up with a matrix that will look
    like this:
  </p>
  <pre>
Address            Line   Column File   ISA Discriminator Flags
------------------ ------ ------ ------ --- ------------- -------------
0x0000000000000003      3      0      5   0             0  is_stmt
0x0000000000000025      4      3      5   0             0  is_stmt prologue_end
0x0000000000000098      0      3      5   0             0
0x0000000000000099      4      3      5   0             0
0x00000000000000b6      0      3      5   0             0
0x00000000000000b7      4      3      5   0             0
0x00000000000000d5      4      3      5   0             0  end_sequence
0x00000000000000d6    767      0      1   0             0  is_stmt
0x00000000000000d7    788     17      1   0             0  is_stmt prologue_end
0x00000000000000dc      0     17      1   0             0
0x00000000000000de      0     17      1   0             0  end_sequence
  </pre>
  <p>
    You can see here that in file 5 (which happens to be main.zig) line 4 and
    column 3 corresponds to the instruction at address 0x0025. Pretty
    straightforward.
  </p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    This article did not go into all the gory details of the line number program
    virtual machine instruction set but the DWARF standard does a pretty good
    job at that. In the <a class="visible-link"
    href=blog-entry.html?article=20220917-sourcemap-in-wasm.html>next
    article</a>, we will finally see how we can use this information to generate
    the inline sourcemap to be added to the WASM buffer and enable the browser's
    debugger.
