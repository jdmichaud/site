  <h3>From DICOM to MPR (Follow-up)</h3>
  <p>
    Many of view have asked me to show a little more than just static images of
    the MPR rendering algorithm. So it took a little time but it's finally here!
    Lo and behold! The MPR rendering in pure javascript. You even have a glance
    of the WebGL rendering is second half of the video.

    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><video controls autoplay src="../assets/pig-mpr.webm" style="width: 70%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>I give you: the pig!</p></div>

    Another prototype I have been working on is the MIP (Mininum Intensity
    Projection) algorithm, entirely in the browser in pure javascript. It's
    pretty slow but it still show what modern browsers are capable of. Enjoy!
