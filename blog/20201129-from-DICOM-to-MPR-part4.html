  <h3>From DICOM to MPR (part 4)</h3>
  <p>
    In the previous installement of this multi-part series of articles we
    discovered the DICOM standards and how it came to be. The way data are
    stored according to DICOM and how these data can be extracted and
    interpreted. We also had a look at the various coordinate system.

  <h4>Coordinate system, a reminder.</h4>
  <p>
    When we work in computer graphics, what we manipulate all the time are
    vector spaces. A space where an element, called a vector, is represented by
    an array of numbers. In a 2D vector space, here is an example of a valid
    vector u=[2, 3]. In themselves, these coordinates do not mean anything. You
    are able to know what this vector represent only if you know the <i>base</i>
    of that vector space. The base is a set of vectors which are going to be
    combined linearly to represent a particular point in our space. Let's assume
    that our 2D vector space has the canonical base i=[1, 0] and j=[0, 1]. Then
    u will be found in the vector space following that linear combination: 2 x i
    + 3 x j. Which, once processed is: 2 x [1, 0] + 3 x [0, 1] = [2, 0] + [0, 3]
    = [2, 3].
