  <h3>Gilbert Strang and Linear Algebra made easy</h3>
  <p>
    If you don't know what linear algebra is, then you must have had the same
    kind of math teacher I had. Linear algebra is the part of math that deals
    with matrices. They are extremely useful in many area of computer science:
    computer graphics, simulation and machine learning. They're a basic tool
    that one must master in order to understand what one is doing in those
    fields.

    Yet, I noticed that it remains a poorly understood field of mathematics, even
    by seasoned engineer, which is a shame. Indeed, math teachers tend to teach
    that subject in a very dry way. They'll tend to focus on the resolution of
    system of equations and spending a lot of time on definition and formal
    proof, which end up confusing the listener. I guess it depends in which
    country you went to school to, but I had to learn by heart how to solve a
    limited set of typical problems that would then have to be solved again
    without my textbook during the exam. That is really not the best way to
    understand something. It's just a memory exercise.

    Enter <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/" class="visible-link">Gilbert
    Strang</a>. I stumbled upon his website a long time ago and started watching
    his LinAlg lectures. Gilbert Strang is a Professor of Mathematics at the
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He's been teaching there for
    decades and have a specialty in LinAlg. He honed a well rehearsed LinAgl
    class for years and is one of the first teacher to have published his <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/" class="visible-link">lectures online</a>
    at the end of the 90s.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prof. Strang's lectures are remarkable on many levels. First, he's not
    focused on demonstration or definition, even though they are effectively
    present in his lectures. It happens that they are not at the center of its
    teaching but rather a consequence of your own understanding. Prof. Strang
    will insist on the many interpretation of a fact, giving you the various
    aspect of a mathematical truth. He will show you the dots and then help you
    connect them. This is clearly visible in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7DzL2_Na80" class="visible-link">the first video of the course</a>
    which is entitled the "Geometry of Linear Algebra". Right into it, Prof.
    Strang will give you the geometric interpretation of a matrix. What the rows
    represent, what the columns represent. He's not jumping on the system of
    equation bandwagon but only to tell you that's not what this is about. What
    this is about is manipulating objects which, although conceptual, have a real
    meaning in an every day engineer's life.

  <p>
    The fundamental truth that you will quickly grasp, thanks to Prof. Strang
    clear enunciation, is that matrices are a way to transform vectors. Be it
    rotation, skewing and even translation in case of homogeneous matrices, what
    you are doing when using a matrix is move things. Once you understand this
    fundamental and clearly simple concept then everything makes sense. A matrix
    is about changing perspective or, mathematically, changing your coordinate
    system. A matrix inverse is about putting an object back where it was.
    Finding the rank is understanding how you matrix preserve or transform the
    spaces in which your objects live in. Computing an eigenvector is
    extracting, from this seemingly formless bag of numbers, the axe upon which
    the transformation revolves around. Even the somehow complex notion of
    Singular Value Decomposition becomes clear and intuitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prof. Strang strength relies on many factors but one important aspect is his
    empathy. You can clearly see that he thinks with the mind of a student. Even
    though the technique of lecture ex cathedra is not particularly innovative,
    his diction, his posture, his flow of thinking are all guided toward the
    goal of taking your hand and slowly but surely remove you from the darkness
    of confusion to the warming light of understanding. Many times during the
    course I caught myself smiling, even laughing sometimes at the discovery of
    a seemingly simple truth which had eluded me all these years.
  </p>
  <p>
    One important aspect of Prof. Strang's class is that it comes with its
    <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/" class="visible-link">own textbook</a>.
    The class matches the chapter and the book is definitely a necessary
    companion to the lectures. It goes deeper on certain concept, clarifies some
    points and provide exercises which, let's be blunt, are necessary if you
    ever want to master and remember what you are learning.

    Now spending time watching Prof. Strang's lectures while reading the book is
    certainly a substantial investment of your time. But an investment which
    will be well rewarded in the clearer understanding of one of the most
    fundamental tool of engineering.
