  <h3>A dissection of a clever little avatar generator from HN</h3>
  <p>

    On the 14th of March 2022 a <a class="visible-link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30668137">"Show HN" article</a>
    by user tomxor appeared on the popular tech news aggregation site <a class="visible-link" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
    demonstrating a little piece of JS code that could add a nice avatar next
    to each username. Indeed, HN design is quite minimalist and, except for
    the username, nothing distinguish a comment from another in the comment
    thread. Most people like it this way. That little piece of code worked
    its magic with very few characters. Here it is:

  </p>

  <pre><code class="javascript">
for(u of document.querySelectorAll('.hnuser'))
for(u.prepend(c=document.createElement('canvas')),x=c.getContext('2d'),c.width=18,c.height=14,
s=u.innerText,r=1,i=28+s.length;i--;i&lt;28?r&gt;&gt;&gt;29&gt;X*X/3+Y/2&&
x.fillRect(6+2*X,2*Y,2,2)&x.fillRect(6-2*X,2*Y,2,2):r+=s.charCodeAt(i-28,x.fillStyle='#'+
(r&gt;&gt;8&0xFFFFFF).toString(16)))r^=r&lt;&lt;13,r^=r&gt;&gt;&gt;17,r^=r&lt;&lt;5,X=i&3,Y=i&gt;&gt;2
  </code></pre>

  <p>

    We will try to analyse it here. Why do it? Because it is absolutely
    useless and as a consequence, extemely urgent to do so. First of all, for
    those who haven't tried it, it will generate an avatar depending on you
    username. Usernames being unique, every username will have a unique
    avatar. There is no random number being used here, it's all procedural
    generation, so as long as you keep the same username, your avatar will
    not change. The avatar is arranged on a 14x18 canvas right before you
    username. For example, here is the avatar for the username 'pg':

  </p>

  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/pg-avatar.png" style="width: 256px; height: 256px"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>pg's avatar.</p></div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Now, let's have a look at the code. If we arrange it a little:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="javascript">
for(u of document.querySelectorAll('.hnuser'))
  for(u.prepend(
    c=document.createElement('canvas')),
    x=c.getContext('2d'),
    c.width=18,
    c.height=14,
    s=u.innerText,
    r=1,
    i=28+s.length;

    i--;

    i&lt;28 ? r&gt;&gt;&gt;29&gt;X*X/3+Y/2&&x.fillRect(6+2*X,2*Y,2,2)&x.fillRect(6-2*X,2*Y,2,2)
           :r+=s.charCodeAt(i-28,x.fillStyle='#'+(r&gt;&gt;8&0xFFFFFF).toString(16)))

    r^=r&lt;&lt;13,
    r^=r&gt;&gt;&gt;17,
    r^=r&lt;&lt;5,
    X=i&3,
    Y=i&gt;&gt;2
  </code></pre>

  <p>

    We have a first for loop that goes through all the <code>.hnuser<code> entries in
    the page (the usernames). For each of those we have a loop which, in its
    initialization expression, is creating a canvas, in its condition
    expression, check that the variable i is different from 0 and decrements
    it and in its increment expression, calls `fillRect` and
    `fillStyle`. It's were the avatar is being drawn. Finally, in the body of
    the for loop, a few variables are being modified.

  </p>

  <p>

    Let's try to rework all this a little to improve readability and be able
    to manipulate it:

  </p>

  <pre><code class="javascript">
function avatar(s) {
  const c = document.createElement('canvas');
  const x = c.getContext('2d');
  c.width = 18;
  c.height = 14;
  let r = 1;
  let i = 28 + s.length;

  while (i--) {
    r ^= r &lt;&lt; 13;
    r ^= r &gt;&gt;&gt; 17;
    r ^= r &lt;&lt; 5;
    X = i & 3;
    Y = i &gt;&gt; 2;

    i &lt; 28 ? r &gt;&gt;&gt; 29 &gt; X * X / 3 + Y / 2 && x.fillRect(6 + 2 * X, 2 * Y, 2, 2) & x.fillRect(6 - 2 * X, 2 * Y, 2, 2)
           : r += s.charCodeAt(i - 28, x.fillStyle = '#'+(r &gt;&gt; 8 & 0xFFFFFF).toString(16));
  }

  return c;
}
  </code></pre>

  <p>

    Here I have removed the for loops. I only get a function that takes a
    username and returns a canvas with a drawn avatar in it. Note that the
    inner for loop was transformed to a while loop. The for loop body is
    moved up as the increment expression is always executed after the for
    loop's body. First we can note that the avatar contains a right margin of
    two pixels(blue-ish pixels on the right). The canvas width is 18 but only
    14 columns are used. This allows a little separation with the username. Then,
    the avatar is symmetric so we only have to come up with half of it. The
    other half will be mirrored (grayed out), that's why we have two `fillRect`
    calls, one for the left part and one for the right.

  </p>

  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/pg-avatar-detail.png" style="width: 256px; height: 256px"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>pg's avatar.</p></div>
  </div>

  </p>

    Now there is something strange that I did not understand which is: why do we
    draw 2x2 pixels on a 14x14 canvas instead of just drawing 1x1 pixels on a
    7x7 canvas? For example, modifying the function to:

  </p>

  <pre><code class="javascript">
function avatar(s) {
  const c = document.createElement('canvas');
  const x = c.getContext('2d');
  c.width = 9;
  c.height = 7;
  let r = 1;
  let i = 28 + s.length;

  while (i--) {
    r ^= r &lt;&lt; 13;
    r ^= r &gt;&gt;&gt; 17;
    r ^= r &lt;&lt; 5;
    X = i & 3;
    Y = i &gt;&gt; 2;

    i &lt; 28 ? r &gt;&gt;&gt; 29 &gt; X * X / 3 + Y / 2 && x.fillRect(3 + X, Y, 1, 1) & x.fillRect(3 - X, Y, 1, 1)
           : r += s.charCodeAt(i - 28, x.fillStyle = '#'+(r &gt;&gt; 8 & 0xFFFFFF).toString(16));
  }

  return c;
}
  </code></pre>

  <p>

  Gives use exactly the same avatar. We only divided everything by 2
  (canvas size and `fillRect` parameters). Let's move on, we will place this
  piece of code in an <a class="visible-link"
  href="https://gist.github.com/jdmichaud/97cf97429ff2231301c8cd3a10eb40ab">HTML
  page</a> in order to fiddle with it a little:

  </p>

  <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    /************ PLACE YOUR AVATAR FUNCTION HERE ************/

    function main() {
      window.ctx = document.getElementById('c').getContext('2d');
      window.ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = false;
    }

    window.onload = main;
  &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
    canvas {
      border: 1px solid lightgray;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;canvas id="c" width=512 height=512&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
  </code></pre>

  <p>

    This way we can just call <pre><code class="javascript">ctx.drawImage(avatar('pg'), 0, 0, 512, 512)</code></pre> in the console to see our avatar in a nice
    512x512 canvas.

  </p>

  <p>

    So once we've understood that we are only deciding what to do with half of
    7x7 canvas (including the central column), we realise that we get
    (7x4)<sup>2</sup> different avatars. The rest 7x3 pixels being a mirrors
    of the first 7x3.

  </p>

  <p>

    So how do we fill up those 28 pixels ? First note that the variable `i` is
    initialized at 28 + the length of the username. I have rewritten the
    ternary operator, at the end, with an `if` condition to reveal what is
    going on:

  </p>

  <pre><code class="javascript">
if (i &gt;= 28) {
  r += s.charCodeAt(i - 28);
  x.fillStyle = '#'+(r &gt;&gt; 8 & 0xFFFFFF).toString(16);
} else {
  r &gt;&gt;&gt; 29 &gt; X * X / 3 + Y / 2 && x.fillRect(3 + X, Y, 1, 1) & x.fillRect(3 - X, Y, 1, 1)
}
  </code></pre>

  <p>

    I have inverted the condition as well so that the clause are executed in
    the chronological order. First, `i` is greater than 28 obviously and we
    will then start by scanning (with `charCodeAt`) the username letter and
    use them to intialize r. It means that for each username, r will end up
    being initialized to a unique value. This is our seed. Then `fillStyle`
    is called repeateadly to initialize a color which whill be unique
    depending on r. The multiple calls are useless, only the last one matter,
    but I guess there was no avoiding multiple calls in order to limit the
    code size.

  </p>

  <p>

    Once we have scanned the username, `i` is then less than 28. We will start
    filling up the canvas with the `fillRect` calls. For this, `X` and `Y`
    are used as pixels coordinates. X is masked against `i` with the value 3
    (11 in binary). It means that `X` will vary between 0 and 3. This is the
    equivalent of % 3. Perfect to scan the lines or our 7x4 half (yes, 0, 1,
    2 and 3 will be the index of our 4 columns). `Y` will be the integer part
    of the division of `i` by 4. This is what a right shift by 2 (`>> 2`)
    does. For example, 27 shifted by 2 is: `0b11011` (27 ) >> 2 = `0b110`
    (6). Note that 6 will be the result for `i` = 27, 26, 25 and 24. Indeed
    the last two bits will vary 4 times which is right enough for our `X` to
    go through all the pixels of the lines!:

  </p>

  <pre><code class="javascript">
X 3 Y 6
X 2 Y 6
X 1 Y 6
X 0 Y 6
X 3 Y 5
X 2 Y 5
X 1 Y 5
X 0 Y 5
[...]
X 0 Y 0
  </code></pre>

  <p>

    Now that we are scanning those 28 pixels, we just need to fill them up.
    This is where the magic happens. Notice that in the loop, `r` is being
    manipulated to vary according to a certain pattern. Shift right, shift
    left. Finally, in the `else` clause we test if `r` shifted by 29 is
    greater than some combination of `X` and `Y` if yes (`&&`) we call ou
    `fillRect` otherwise we don't.

  </p>

  <p>

    `r` is being manipulated with boolean operators so it is always treated as
    a 32 bits integer. By shifting by 29 we basically only get the 3 most
    significant bits of the result of the bits twiddling. We will get
    a "pseudo-random" value between 0 and 7. On the other side of the
    condition `X * X / 3 + Y / 2` will vary between 3 * 1 + 6 / 2 (6) and 0.
    We draw a pixel only when `r` is greater, which means that we will get
    more "on" pixels than "off" pixels. We draw that conclusion from the fact
    that the the value for `r >>> 29` are continuously distributed:

  </p>

  <pre><code class="javascript">
r = 534;
a = []
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) {
  r ^= r &lt;&lt; 13;
  r ^= r &gt;&gt;&gt; 17;
  r ^= r &lt;&lt; 5;
  x = r &gt;&gt;&gt; 29;
  a[x] = a[x] === undefined ? 0 : a[x] + 1;
}
a: Array(8) [ 12667, 12440, 12490, 12460, 12637, 12582, 12171, 12545 ]
  </code></pre>

  <p>

    The center of the avatar will probably contain more on pixels, due to the
    value of X being at its max there. Same thing for the bottom of the
    avatar.

  </p>

  <p>
    Anyway, nice little exercise. Congrats to the author. back to work!
