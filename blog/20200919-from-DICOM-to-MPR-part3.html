  <h3>From DICOM to MPR (part 3)</h3>
  <p>
    This is the third part of 5 parts series. Link to <a href="blog-entry.html?article=20201129-from-DICOM-to-MPR-part4.html" class="visible-link">part 4</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the first part of this series we had a look at what DICOM is and how
    it came to be. On the second part we had a deep dive into the nitty-gritty
    details of how a DICOM file comes alive and become an actual image. But this
    was only a slice of a volume. In this series we will understand how DICOM
    files come together to create an actual three dimensional volume. But first,
    a little reminder of some basic math principles. If your confortable with that,
    you can jump to <a href="#patient-coordinate-system" class="visible-link">
    the second half of this article</a>.
  </p>
  <h4>Coordinate system, a reminder.</h4>
  <p>
    When we work in computer graphics, what we manipulate all the time are
    vector spaces. A space where an element, called a vector, is represented by
    an array of numbers. In a 2D vector space, here is an example of a valid
    vector u=[2, 3]. In themselves, these coordinates do not mean anything. You
    are able to know what this vector represent only if you know the <i>base</i>
    of that vector space. The base is a set of vectors which are going to be
    combined linearly to represent a particular point in our space. Let's assume
    that our 2D vector space has the canonical base i=[1, 0] and j=[0, 1]. Then
    u will be found in the vector space following that linear combination: 2 x i
    + 3 x j. Which, once processed is: 2 x [1, 0] + 3 x [0, 1] = [2, 0] + [0, 3]
    = [2, 3].
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/base.svg" style="width: 15%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>A vector as a linear combination of the base vector</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    But the canonical base [i, j] is not the only possible one. Any set of vectors
    which are independent from each other (meaning one cannot be expressed as a
    linear combination of the other) can be used as a base as long as the set
    contains as many vector as dimensions in our the space, in our case: 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's define another set of vectors: i'=[1, 1] and j=[-1, 1] as a base:
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/base2.svg" style="width: 15%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>A base can be any set of independent vectors</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    i' can be expressed in the [i, j] base as [1, 1]. To obtain i' you need to
    add one i and one j. j' can expressed as [-1, 1]. But if we where to take
    [i', j'] as a base, then, quite naturally, their coordinates would be i'=[1,
    0] and j'=[0, 1] by their "basic" nature. So depending on the base, the
    coordinates varies of course.
  </p>
  <p>
    An important question is how do we convert the coordinate expressed on base
    Ba to the same vector expressed in another base Bb ? Well let's take the same
    simple example. We know i' = [1, 0] in the base [i', j']. If we want to know
    its coordinates in the canonical base [i, j], we just need to compute
    the linear combination of [i', j'] by i': 1 x i + 0 x j' with i' and j'
    expressed in the destination base, without loss of generality, so:
    1 x [1, 1] + 0 x [-1, 1] = [1, 1].
    The example is trivial here because we are using i' to compute i' but as
    indicated, the reasoning is general and can be apply to any vector expressed
    in [i', j'].
  </p>
  <p>
    As you may know, computing a linear combination of two vectors by another
    vector as we just did, is just a matrix multiplication:
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/matrix-mul.svg" style="width: 15%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>A straightforward matrix multiplication</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If you memory of linear algebra are a little fuzzy, I advise you to have a
    look at <a class="visible-link" href="http://mathdown.novidee.com/toHtml?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jdmichaud/7ff72cc2a9f19e93ff47ee143232ca5c/raw/linalg.md">
    this refresher I sumed up</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To generalize, if our vector is expressed in the base Ba = [b1, b2], then
    to convert from this base to the canonical base you just need to multiply
    that vector by the matrix as follows:
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/convert-to-canonical.svg" style="width: 30%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>Convert from Ba to [i, j]</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    How to go to Bb now? Well that's trivial. Matrices are objects that
    transform vectors. Some of those transformations are called invertible
    because, well, you can invert them. If you take an object and push it 10cm
    to the right, if you apply the opposite transformation, push it 10cm to the
    left (or -10cm to the right !), the object will end up exactly in the same
    position. So to go from Ba to [i, j], multiply by the Ba matrix. To go from
    [i, j] to Bb, multiply by the inverse of the inverse of the Bb matrix.
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/convert-from-canonical.svg" style="width: 20%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>Some matrices are invertible</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    We can now transform the coordinates of a vector from one base to another
    pretty easily. Note that I did not go into the details of how to invert a
    matrix. While not being necessarily complicated, it is quite tedious, so
    you can refer to the aforementioned link.
  </p>
  <p>
    All this is well and good but all those bases have the same origin: 0. A
    coordinate system should be able to express a base but also an origin. And
    when an origin is in place, you need more than just skewing and rotating your
    vector to convert between coordinate systems, you also need to translate.
    This is where the homogeneous matrix enters the scene. This matrix is also
    able to translate a coordinate. Note that we don't talk about translating
    vector as it does not make sense mathematically. Only points are translated.
  </p>
  <p>
    An homogeneous matrix is a sort of mathematical Frankenstein's monster. It
    contains many information and look a little unbalanced. But its a very powerful
    tool that you will need to understand in order to go further. It looks like:
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/homogeneous-matrix.svg" style="width: 15%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>Frankenstein's matrix</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    The m*s are performing the skewing and rotation. The tx and ty the
    translation. The dangling 1 in the bottom right does the trick. But for this
    matrix to work, you will have to manipulate particular kind of points. They,
    too, will have a dangling 1 and it will used to apply the translation after
    the rotation/skeweing. If the last element of your point is 0, not 1, then
    the translation is not applied and what you have is not a point, but a vector
    indeed:
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/homogeneous-matrix-multiplying-point.svg" style="width: 20%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>It's alive !</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Now all this works in 2D as well as in 3D or anyD for that matter. You just
    need to extend the dimensions of the matrices, vectors and points you
    manipulate. From a mathemical point of view, all theses rules apply the same
    in any dimension and only your memory space is the limit.
  </p>
  <h4 id="patient-coordinate-system">The patient coordinate system</h4>
  <p>
    Now that the math is out of the way, let's dwelve back into DICOM. If we
    deal with 3D data, as we suppose we are, we need to position them in space.
    The convention DICOM follows is that the "canonical" coordinate system used
    is aligned with the patient. It is the <a class="visible-link"
    href="http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.6.2.html">
    "patient coordinate system"</a>. If you were to be standing, you legs
    together, arms appart pointing to your left and right, and your eyes fixed
    to the horizon, the X-axis is your arms, the Y-axis is the direction of your
    gaze and the Z-axis you body. So this gives us the axis but not their
    direction. This is where some vocabulary is needed. In medicine, Left and
    Right are still called this way. Where you feet goes is Inferior and where
    your head is Superior. In front of you is Anterior and behind you Posterior.
    The DICOM coordinate system is, most often called LPS: Left-Posterior-Superior
    and can be represented this way:
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/800px-DICOM-OrientationDiagram-LPS.png" style="width: 30%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>LPS Coordinate System (Kitware Attribution 2.5)</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    This gives the axis but not the origin. The origin is arbitrary. It's not
    important as long at it is coherent. You might have seen on TV or in movies,
    that when patients are being installed in a scanner, some red laser forming
    an X over their head or nose or belly button. This is what is used to
    indicate the origin to the machine. It is useful to indicate a reference
    point so then you can compare different datasets from different exams without
    too much registration. Anyway, the origin is a point in space where 0 is 0.
    That's it.
  </p>
  <p>
    From that point on, all the coordinates you will find in DICOM will be based
    on this coordinate system and their units will be, expect in some cases, in
    millimeters. Let's suppose the head of the patient is at [0, 0, 0], a point
    at [12, 34, 41] is 10mm closer to the head than [12, 34, 51]. What an
    imaging system generates when it generates 3D data is a volume. This volume
    is independent of the patient. Of course, the purpose is to treat patient so
    the volume will most certainly contain the whole or part of the patient's
    anatomy but technically this is not a necessity and should never be taken
    for granted. This means that volume can be aligned with the patient axes
    <b>or not</b> and one should always be careful to never lose generality by
    assuming any link between the patient coordinate system and the volume
    coordinate system.
  </p>
  <h4>The volume coordinate system</h4>
  <p>
    A 3D volume is constituted of slices. Each slice is a 2D array of voxels and
    voxels are basically 3D pixels ; little square containing a value as
    acquired by the acquisition device. We will not be getting into all the
    possible storage variations. The most simple case is when each of those
    slices are stored into an individual DICOM file called an instance. This
    instance will contain all the necessary metadata to interpret the slice: the
    pixel data (size in bits, interpretation, number of rows and column) but
    also all the positioning information we need to precisely know where each
    pixel is positioned in the LPS system. These information comes from the
    <a class="visible-link"
    href="http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.6.2.html">
    Image Plane Module as defined in DICOM.</a>
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/slice-coordinate-system.svg" style="width: 74%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>Slice Coordinate System</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    The slice coordinate system needs an origin, two axes (being a 2D coodinate
    system in a 3D vector space) and a unit (the voxel). In each DICOM instance
    representing a slice, the field (0020,0032) Image Position Patient will
    indicate the origin of the slice in the LPS coordinate system. It positions
    the whole slice in space. It indicates the center of the top-left voxel of
    the slice. There is an important subtility here: it is the center of the
    voxel, not the top-left corner of the voxel that this field relates to. A
    common mistake is to forget that. The orientation is given by (0020,0032)
    Image Orientation Patient. The field contain 6 numbers. The first 3 are the
    X-axis of the slice and the last 3 are the Y-axis. The SCS is still not
    defined though because Image Orientation Patient contains normalized vector,
    thus the "size" of the voxel is not yet integrated. For this, we need to
    consider that the unit of the coordinate system is the size of the voxel
    itself. This is provided by the (0028,0030) Pixel Spacing field. Here again,
    we talk about well-behaved DICOM files. But as it happens, Pixel Spacing is
    not always present or can be overidded by other fields. We assume, in our
    case, that Pixel Spacing gives us what we want. This field is an array of
    two numbers. The first is the distance between the center of each voxel of
    the slice and the voxel right below. The second is the the distance between
    the center of each voxel of the slice with the center of the voxel
    immediately to the right.
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/PS3.3_10.7.1.3-1.svg" style="width: 40%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>(0028,0030) Pixel Spacing</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    So how do we extend the slice coordinate to the volume coordinate system,
    including the Z axis? Well by first noting again that we are treating a
    particular case, which is the most common case: aligned slices. Indeed, each
    slice is independent, there is no garantee that slices are parallel to each
    other or aligned. Some system will produce non-parallel slice for CBCT
    acquisition for example, or when the volume is skewed with respect to the
    axis of the slice. Let's not worry about that here. Our slices are
    considered all parallel and aligned and form a nice cube-like structure in
    space.
  </p>
  <p>
    In that case, the origin of our volume is the origin of our first slice. The
    X and Y-axes of our volume is the X and Y-axes of the first slice. Simple
    enough. The Z-axis is the cross-product of X over Y:
    Z&nbsp;=&nbsp;X&nbsp;x&nbsp;Z. Z will then indicate the direction of the
    next slices in the volume. We will set the length of Z to the distance
    between the Image Position Patient of the first slice and the Image Position
    Patient of the second slice, so each increment in the Z direction gives use
    the next slice. So all in all [0, 0, 0] is the first voxel of the first row
    of our first slice. [1, 2, 3] is the second voxel of the third raw of the
    fourth slice of the volume.
  </p>
  <h4>Convertion</h4>
  <p>
    And Now the final step. We will create the homogeneous matrix representing
    the volume coordinate system and let the math do the work. This matrix will
    help us know:
    <ul>
      <li>The coordinate in LPS of any voxel</li>
      <li>The index of a voxel at a particular place in space</li>
    </ul>
    The skewing/rotation part of the matrix will be made of the X and Y
    vector from the Image Orientation Patient of the first slice and the Z
    vector as the cross product of those two. The translation (t) then is just
    the Image Position Patient of the first slice:
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/volume-matrix.svg" style="width: 20%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>The volume homogeneous matrix</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    This is our Ba matrix. In input it will take a vector containing the indices
    of a voxel in the volume and will give its position in space in output.
    Invert the matrix and you will get the opposite transformation.
  </p>
  <h4>The camera and its coordinate system</h4>
  <p>
    The final piece of the coordinate system puzzle is the camera. The pinhole
    camera model has been the bread and butter of 3D computer graphics and we
    will not go into much detail here as this case has been covered many times
    over. You can try to wrap your head around the <a class="visible-link"
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera_model">Wikipedia page</a>
    but I find the explanation from <a class="visible-link" href="https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/3d-viewing-pinhole-camera/virtual-pinhole-camera-model">
    scratchapixel</a> more intuitive.
  </p>
    Our camera model is pretty simple. It relies on two points and a vector: eye
    point, look point and the up vector. The camera plane is the plane going
    through the look point and perpendicular to the camera direction indicated
    by the vector (look point - eye point). The plane segment, called the camera
    plane, is delimited by the <b>Field Of View</b> (FOV) which, in our case,
    will be defined as the height of the camera plane in millimeters. Note that
    the FOV is usually defined as the diagonal. To simplify here, we consider
    that the camera plane as a square (FOVx = FOVy). The up vector gives us the
    orientation of the camera plane. Rotating the camera is then a matter of
    rotating the up vector:
  <p>
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/camera-model.svg" style="width: 50%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>The camera model</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    But keep in mind that the pinhole camera presented all over the internet is
    usually meant as a projection of a 3D space into a plane. In the case of an
    MPR rendering, the camera is going to be used differently. The camera plane
    is going to cut through the volume and each pixel of the camera is going to
    be mapped with a volume voxel:
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/camera-cut-volume.svg" style="width: 40%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>The camera plane cut the volume</p></div>
  </div>
  <h5>The origin</h5>
  <p>
    The coordinate system of the camera is starting to appear clearly. Let's
    start with the origin. The top-left corner of the camera plane can be
    obtained from the look point and moving it along the plane following the up
    vector direction by FOV/2 mm will position it at the top edge. We need now
    to move it to the left again by FOV/2 mm and that's it. But how to know what
    is left? We have the up vector giving us up, but no left vector. We are
    going to create one. More precisely, we are going to create a "right" vector
    which is the cross product of the direction vector (look point - eye point)
    by the up vector: right = (look-eye) x up. Moving the look point to the left
    just mean moving it along the -right vector.
  </p>
  <h5>The base</h5>
  <p>
    We will create a coordinate system which as simple as possible and set aside
    efficient computation aside. The base of our coordinate system will
    encompass the whole camera plane. It means that between 0 and 1 you will
    live in that segment. Outside of that range, you are out of the segment.
    This greatly simplified the explaination but will lead us to perform some
    unecessary costly floating point arithmetic, especially division, but
    efficiency is not the point of this series of articles anyway.
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/camera-coordinate-system.svg" style="width: 40%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>The camera coordinate system</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Those axes then are pretty easy to define. The X-axis is the normalized
    right vector multiplied by the FOV (remember that the camera plane is a
    square so its width and height is equal to the FOV). The Y-axis is the
    normalized up vector multiplied by -FOV. "Minus" because the Y-axis
    direction is opposed to the up vector.
  </p>
  <h5>The matrix</h5>
  <p>
    "What is the matrix?". Well, we have all the elements to build it now. Let's
    define:
    <ul>
      <li>X = -FOV * |up|</li>
      <li>Y = FOV * |right| and</li>
      <li>O = look + FOV / 2 * |up| - FOV / 2 * |right|</li>
    </ul>
    our matrix end up being:
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/camera-matrix.svg" style="width: 15%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>The camera homogeneous matrix</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Note that although our plane is a 2D space, it remains that we are still
    situated in a 3D space so the matrix also as a Z component which is the null
    vector here. And our point in our camera plane are still homogeneous 3D
    points so if we were to represent the look point for example, it would look
    like: [0.5,&nbsp;0.5,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1].
  </p>
  <p>
    Here again we can use this matrix to go to and from the patient coordinate
    system. So we are now free to hop from the camera to the patient to the
    volume coordinate system freely and very easily by multiplying matrices and
    their inverses with ease.
  </p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>
    We are getting close. We have all the tools now to render an arbitrary plane
    in our volume. We just need to put it all together: reading the DICOM,
    extracting the pixels, positioning the plane and rendering our image. From
    all the complexity of that subject, the resulting code will be deceptively
    simple because the underlying mathematical operation is simple. The
    complexity is in the details.
