  <h3>Portable development environments</h3>
  <p>
    The day-to-day life of a developer is that of a master of tools. Tools to
    write, compile, link, test, package, distribute. Not unlike heavy machinery
    which is an extension of the body, those tools are an extension of the mind
    that allows one person to produce an enormous amount of value with limited
    effort. But those tools can also be a bane. To install, configure, maintain and
    most importantly master.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since the 80s, as complexity of the development environement grew, no
    solution was proposed to simplify and streamline the developer's experience.
    When I started my career, in 2005, I joined a team that was still living the
    90s life. Proprietary version control system, that would require the
    intervention of multiple support team to onboard to. Dependencies installed
    manually from CDs ! A full set of environment variables and software to
    configure and install. It would takes weeks for a newcomer to have a fully
    working development environment. And very few team members, except the
    oldest, those who've been there from the start, actually knew how all this
    was working.
  </p>
  <p>
    But the advent of web technologies brought a wind of change. <tt>npm</tt>,
    the node package manager, suddenly allowed a developer to explicitely
    describe, in a simple json file, what are its dependencies and what the
    projects needs to convert its source code to the final deliverable. The
    <tt>npm</tt> people were smart enough to split the concept of dependencies
    between what was needed to generate an artifact (the development
    dependencies) and what what needed to actually run the software, the
    dependencies. From now on, a project could specify, in a human readable way,
    what tools (with their version) and what software factory steps are needed
    to produce your project artefact and what libraries are needed to use this
    artifact. This file, called <tt>package.json</tt> was standardized and
    would be a convention for all web based development project. All those
    dependencies would be downloaded from a central repository (of course
    configurable) and you would never ever need to find the CD-Rom or even the
    web link of the proper version of this or that tool again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, initially the solution was immature. You were still needed to
    play around with some rough edges (i.e. grunt/gulp) to get your software
    factory moving but as of today, npm can be fully leveraged to pilot that
    facotry in a simple and transparent manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's take a simple example. You write a project in typescript. You need to
    transpile the source to javascript, unit test it and bundle it in a form
    that can be easily consumed by a browser. You will first create a
    <tt>package.json</tt> file:
    <pre>
        {
          "name": "my-project",
        }
    </pre>
    That's it, you have a valid <tt>package.json</tt> file. Let's install what's
    necessary to transpile your project:
    <pre>
        $ npm install --save-dev typescript
    </pre>
    You instruct <tt>npm</tt> you will need a development dependencies. This
    development dependencies is necessary to the developer but not to the user
    of your software. More on this later. Now your <tt>package.json</tt> looks
    like this (version notwithstanding):
    <pre>
        {
          "name": "my-project",
          "devDependencies": {
            "typescript": "^3.9.2"
          }
        }
    </pre>
    You create a source file:
    <pre>
        $ cat > main.ts
        function main(): void {
          console.log('Hello world!');
        }

        window.onload = main;
    </pre>
    Now let's configure <tt>npm</tt> to build your project:
    <pre>
        {
          "name": "my-project",
          "scripts": {
            "build": "tsc main.ts"
          },
          "devDependencies": {
            "typescript": "^3.9.2"
          }
        }
    </pre>
    Then build it:
    <pre>
        $ npm run build
    </pre>
    Your project is built. It took a bit of effort but from now on, if any
    developer clone your project and try to build, all they need to do is:
    <pre>
        $ npm install && npm run build
    </pre>
    And! That! Is! It! Compared to the old ways, this is a revolution. In our
    case, the setup is pretty simple but if you need unit test, a linter and a
    publishing workflow, you can just describe these in the
    <tt>package.json</tt> file. You can find a example of this <a class="visible-link"
    href="https://github.com/jdmichaud/ts-boiler-plate/blob/master/package.json">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    From now on, onboarding developer is a breeze. Training aside, you can have
    a developer ready in the time it takes to install <tt>git</tt> and
    <tt>npm</tt>. The gain in productivity is enormous. Also, note that all this
    tooling is useless to the user of your software and <tt>npm</tt> will
    carefuly avoid installing the development dependencies when a user of your
    package request it. It will however install the "dependencies" which are the
    library your software needs to run properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now everything is not so rosy. You still need to worry about where your
    dependencies are downloaded from. To prevent security issues or just simply
    if you don't like to depend on a free and unreliable piece of infrastructure
    as <a class="visible-link" href="https://registry.npmjs.org/">registry.npmjs.org</a>
    is, you will need to work a little harder and setup some proxy to it like <a
    visible-link href="https://jfrog.com/artifactory/">artifactory</a>, but this
    is a one time effort for which the benefits are obvious. Tools and versions
    are explcitely defined in a human readable way. Build, test and packaging
    steps are documented by their own code in a conventional way and the
    software factory is consistently implemented accross all your projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another caveat of course is that this solution is not universal. It applied
    only to project based on web technologies. Were you to develop software in
    C++ or python, you would have to find equivalent tools, <b>if you can</b>.
    In that regards, C++ has been at a disatvantage for a long time. Python has
    <tt>virtualenv</tt> and <tt>pip</tt>, rust has <tt>cargo</tt> (with some
    limitations), java has <tt> maven</tt>. But C++ is lacking a universally
    accepted solution. <a class="visible-link"
    href="https://conan.io/"><tt>conan</tt></a> or <a class="visible-link"
    href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg"><tt>vcpkg</tt></a> or others have
    been trying to fill that gap these last few years but none of them offers
    the simplicity and universality of a solution like <tt>npm</tt>. It will
    probably remain so for many years to come, even though the introduction of
    <a class="visible-link"
    href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/modules">modules</a> in
    C++20 might save the day. Time will tell...
