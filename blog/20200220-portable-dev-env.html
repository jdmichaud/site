    I've heard, multiple times, that developping software is a creative activity
    that could be compared to writing music or writing a book. There is truth
    into that. The mirage of automating software production if far out of reach
    because the creation of value through software requires a higher level of
    thinking than just producing lines of codes. If machines were to ever
    replace humanity, the last human in control will probably be a developer.
    That being said, the analogy with artist as its limitation. First of all,
    software development is rarely an ex-nihilo process, especially when being
    executed professionally. We don't express emotions or visions. We
    systematize ideas to produce value. Ideas that more often than not, not our
    own. Secondly, a software is a product that is way more complex than any
    work of art. It is, most of the time, a collective effort. And it relies on
    multiple layer of technology and abstractions. The way developer used to
    work, 50 years ago, producing every bit manually on a manually built
    computer could be compared with writing a book with a pen and paper. What
    developers are doing today... not so much.

    Compiling your software, linting it, testing it, packaging it. All of this
    relies on a bunch of tools that artist or creative worker do not need to
    bother with. The day-to-day life of a developer is as a master of tools.
    Thoses tools, like heavy machinery, are an extension that allows one person
    to produce an enormous amount of value with limited effort. Those tools can
    also be a bane. To install, configure, maintain and most importantly
    master.

    When I started my career, in 2005, I joined a team that was still living the
    90s life. Proprietary source control system, that would require the
    intervention of multiple support team to onboard to. Dependencies installed
    manually from CDs ! A full set of environment variable and software to
    configure and install. It would takes weeks for a newcomer to have a fully
    working development environment. And very few team members, except the
    oldest, those who've been there from the start, actually knew how all this
    was working.
