  <h2>Use DWARF to debug WASM in the browser (part 3)</h2>
  <h3>Convert the line number program to Source Maps</h3>
  <p>
    In the <a class="visible-link"
    href=blog-entry.html?article=20220910-DWARF-line-program.html>previous
    article</a> we showed how you can use the information extracted from the
    debug section of you WASM binary to extract a correspondence matrix between
    source locations and instruction address. In the last article of the series,
    we are going to convert this data to a source map.
  </p>
  <p>
    Source maps are the DWARF equivalence for the browser. Well, it is a pretty
    inaccurate statement but still useful to understand what source maps are.
    They are used by browsers to download original source files and match the
    current Javascript executed line with the original source code. We need this
    "in browser" because, even though browsers do no execute binary code (at
    least not before WASM), the Javascript code executed in browser rarely looks
    like the code you are editing. First, people are writing more and more
    Typescript and even if they write Javascript, it will often be the case that
    the written Javascript will be transpiled, minified, packaged (and sometime
    even uglyfied along the way) so that trying to debug it without source maps
    is next to impossible.
  </p>
    You will <a class="visible-link" href=https://pvdz.ee/weblog/281>find here a
    pretty good introduction</a> to source maps so you can get detailed
    knowledge of their format.
  <p>
    The idea we are going to follow here is not mine but comes from the
    emscripten team which had the idea of converting DWARF line number programs
    to source maps. They wrote a little <a class="visible-link"
    href=https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/e6b78a3/tools/wasm-sourcemap.py>python
    script</a> which parses the output of <i>dwarfdump</i> and generate a source
    map file. It's pretty neat and works well, however what we are doing is a
    little different. Instead of parsing the output of <i>dwarfdump</i> we are
    reading the DWARF symbol directly (what we've been doing for the last 3
    articles!) and then, instead of generating a file that must be served
    separately we will embed the source maps directly in the WASM file. We will
    be able to do that on the fly, in the browser, instead of relying on a
    separate development process where the source map must be generated and
    hosted on the backend. All in all it is just simpler for the user and allow
    you to even debug WASM that comes from some third party sources, as long as
    it contains the DWARF symbol.
  </p>
  <p>
    A source maps file can look like this:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="json">
{
  "version": 3,
  "names": [],
  "sources": [
    "../../../../snap/zig/5649/lib/std/builtin.zig",
    "main.zig"
  ],
  "sourcesContent": null,
  "mappings": "wEA8vBA,qCAqBgB,GADJ,MChxBZ,4CACW,OAAI,WAAF,sEAAA,OAAT,6BAAA"
}
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    This is, obviously, JSON. We will be using the latest version which is
    version 3. The <b>names</b> field contains strings to be used as references
    elsewhere, like <b>.debug_str</b>. Not used here. <b>sources</b> and
    <b>sourcesContent</b> are used to provide the actual source code you want to
    display in the debugger. There is no <b>sourcesContent</b> yet in DWARF 4
    (maybe in DWARF 5?) but the filenames, as we saw, are available and are
    going to end up in the <b>sources</b> array. Finally the <b>mappings</b>
    array is where the correspondence are made between lines in the interpreted
    Javascript and the source. The entries look cryptic but here to, we have a
    little state machine, albeit a little simpler than the DWARF one, to encode
    this correspondence in a space saving manner.
  </p>
  <h4>Mappings</h4>
  <p>
    First the encoding used is <a class="visible-link"
    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity>VLQ</a> which is
    exactly like LEB128 but for the endianess. On top of the VLQ encoding the
    representation is base64 because the web is based on text and having binary
    data in JSON usually means base64. Each entry in <b>mappings</b> is called a
    segment and contains:
    <ul>
      <li>the column in the interpreted file,</li>
      <li>the index of the file in the <b>sources</b> field,</li>
      <li>the row in the source file corresponding to the aforementioned column and</li>
      <li>the column in the source file.</li>
    </ul>
    So it matches what DWARF gave us in the line number program. Each of the
    values in the mappings are deltas versus the previous values. We always
    increment from the previous segment. The first segment gives the delta from
    0. Source maps can deal with multi-line Javascript of course and a new line
    is usually indicated by a <b>;</b> but in the case of WASM, instructions
    are considered to be all on the same line.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we look at the first segment in the provided example: wEA8vBA, we can
    convert that to:
    <ul>
      <li>wE -> 72</li>
      <li>A -> 0</li>
      <li>8vB -> 766</li>
      <li>A -> 0</li>
    </ul>
    So the column 72 in the WASM source file (which corresponds to the address of
    the instruction) will match, in the file "builtin.zig" the source location
    Line: 766, Column: 0. Based on this, the browser can provide the usual
    debugging experience, at least in terms of breakpoint and stepping feature
    during execution.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want an actual piece of code that convert the DWARF line number
    program to the source maps, <a class="visible-link"
    href=https://github.com/jdmichaud/dwarf-2-sourcemap/blob/fd8184899ddd0fe443baef1c1e70c2da4c9ae0e7/src/d2sm.ts#L936>have
    a look at my dwarf-to-sourcemap project</a> (more on that later).
  </p>
  <h3>Source Maps in WASM</h3>
  <p>
    This is all well and good but once we generate the source maps text, how do
    we embed Source Maps in a WASM file exactly? Well the same way we embed
    DWARF symbols. We will create a custom section called "sourceMappingURL" and
    append the source map in the WASM directly has an "inline" source map.
    Indeed there are two ways for source maps to works. Either, the source maps
    is referenced as a URL like so:
  </p>
  <pre>
    //# sourceMappingURL=http://example.com/path/to/your/sourcemap.map
  </pre>
  <p>
    This is what you would find at the bottom of a Javascript file and would
    instruct the browser to fetch <i>sourcemap.map</i> and associate it with the
    current file. Or you could use an "inline" source map which is basically the
    whole source map file encoded as a base64 url like so:
  </p>
  <pre>
    //# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjozLCJmaWxlIjoi...0=
  </pre>
  <p>
    Here, no need for the browser to fetch the source map file, everything is in
    the base64 code. The advantage is that you do not need to serve the source
    map file which, in our case, would not have been possible because the file
    is generated on the frontend side, in the browser !
  </p>
  <p>
    So once the source map is created, encode it in base64, append a custom section
    titled "sourceMappingURL" and lo and behold: debugging works !
  </p>
  <h3>That's it</h3>
    <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
      <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/dwarf-2-sourcemap-screenshot.jpg" style="width: 1000px; height: 600px"></img></div>
      <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>All this for this!</p></div>
    </div>
    Ok it was a little bit of work but we learn a few stuff along the way and were
    able to make this work. Remains to be seen if this will be useful. Meanwhile
    I fixed the problem I had with my WASM code so it will have to wait for me
    to actually use that stuff ;).
  <h3>dwarf-2-sourcemap</h3>
  <p>
    In the process of writing these articles I wrote <b><a class="visible-link"
    href=https://github.com/jdmichaud/dwarf-2-sourcemap>a tool that
    provides</a></b> the exact service I was looking for when I had trouble with
    my little WASM program. As I already mentioned, nothing here is original,
    some pieces of code, here and there, were already doing the job but not the
    way I wanted to. You could generate the source map with a combination of
    <i>dwarfdump</i> and <i>wasm-sourcemap.py</i> and then use <a
    class="visible-link" href=https://github.com/oasislabs/wasm-sourcemap>this to
    fix the URL generated</a> so it matches the address of your server but that
    was a bunch of tools that, in the end, were not practical. Our solution can
    implemented in the browser and do its thing on the fly. It
    is written in Typescript in a readable way hopefully and can be used as a
    reference for understanding the various concept we talked about here.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, dwarf-2-sourcemap only allow you to see the original code, set
    breakpoints and step over instruction but you can't hover over variables and
    only the raw WASM registers are visible and are not converted to the actual
    variable name. That could be the object of further improvement down the
    line. PR welcomed !
