  <h3 class="title">A little financial maths</h3>
  <p>
    For the first post of 2021 I though about documenting a subject on which I
    delve on a regular basis each time the need to scratch the housing market
    itch appears. When to buy? What to buy? Where to buy? For those owning one
    or multiple properties, the market seems "good" when it rises. However, for
    first time buyer, the housing market is some kind of a dread, especially in
    France where prices has been climbing way faster than wages for years.
  </p>
  <p>
    So regularly I asm myself how much a loan would cost, what would be the
    monthly payment and what if interest rates were to raise, how much the
    housing market would move. To answer all this, you need a little bit of
    background of financial math that I always struggle to recover from my last
    scratching session. So here is a simple explanation of the compound interest
    with monthly payment formula.
  </p>
  <h4>Compound interests</h3>
  <p>
    You learn at school that when you put money in the bank, the money work for
    you (well it actually doesn't, people do). So if you were
    to put 1000€ at an interest rate of 10%, at the end of the year, you would
    end up with 1000€ + 10% of 1000€ = 1100€. The simple form of this equation is:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">1000 × 1.10 = 1100</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If we generalize with <i>a</i> being the capital (here 1000) and <i>r</i>
    being the interest rate of 10% (meaning 0.10):
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">a(1) = a(0) × (1 + r)</div>
  </div>
  <p>On the second year:</p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">a(2) = a(1) × (1 + r)</div>
  </div>
  <p>
  So we can see a pattern appear here. As interests will have to be paid on
  interests received the preceding year, interests are compounded. Series are
  not the best way to represent this, especially if we want to use a computer
  to do the hard work for us. A polynomial form will be way better. This polynomial
  will take the initial capital, the interest rate and the number of years and will
  output the amount with interests:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = a(n-1) × (1 + r)</div>
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = a(n-2) × (1 + r) × (1 + r)</div>
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = a(n-3) × (1 + r) × (1 + r) × (1 + r)</div>
    <div class="eqn">⋮</div>
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = a(0) × (1 + r)<sup>n</sup></div>
  </div>
  <h4>With monthly payments</h4>
  <p>
    Baby stepping to the loan side of this now. When you put money in the bank,
    the bank will loan it to someone who need a loan to buy a house. And the
    dynamic will be exactly the same but in reverse. If you are the borrower,
    the amount <i>a</i> is the the money given to you by the bank at interest
    rate <i>r</i> and if that loan lasts <i>n</i> years, then you end up with
    the same formula.
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = a(0) × (1 + r)<sup>n</sup></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Let's rearange it this way (you will see later why)
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = (1 + r)<sup>n</sup> × a(0)</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    But you will need to pay back some of that at some point right? Usually on
    the very first month, you start paying a monthly amount <i>m</i>. But if you
    start paying back on the first month, you should not have to pay interests
    on the amount you already have paid back. Because of this, banks will usually
    compute compound interests not by year but by month:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = (1 + r/12)<sup>12×n</sup> × a(0)</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    For the sake of readability, from now on, let's rewrite <i>(1 + r/12)</i> to <i>R</i> and
    <i>n</i> becomes months and not years.
    Every month the bank computes the interest rate for the month (<i>r/12</i>).
    So if you were to pay every months, the formula for the first months would look like this:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">a(1) = Ra(0) - m</div>
    <div class="eqn">a(2) = Ra(1) - m</div>
    <div class="eqn">a(2) = R[Ra(0) - m] - m</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Again we can see a pattern here:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = R × … × (Ra(0) - m) - … - m</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If we develop this equation:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = R<sup>n</sup>a(0) - R<sup>n-1</sup>m - R<sup>n-2</sup>m - … - m</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    It's better but still a little awkward. The ellipsis means a loop, we can do metter than that,
    especially if we know that:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">       S = 1 + x + x<sup>2</sup> + … + x<sup>n</sup></div>
    <div class="eqn">  xS - S = x<sup>n+1</sup> - 1</div>
    <div class="eqn">S(x - 1) = x<sup>n+1</sup> - 1</div>
    <div class="eqn">       S = (x<sup>n+1</sup> - 1) / (x - 1)</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    With this formula, we simplify to:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = R<sup>n</sup>a(0) - R<sup>n-1</sup>m - R<sup>n-2</sup>m - … - m</div>
    <div class="eqn">a(n) = R<sup>n</sup>a(0) - m × (R<sup>n</sup> - 1) / (R - 1)</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    What does this formula gives us? On the left side, it will accumulate the
    amount of money that you still owe to the bank and on the right side the
    amount you already paid back. Once <i>a</i> reaches 0, you have paid back
    you loan in full, capital plus interest.
  </p>
  <h4>How long to repay a loan?</h4>
  <p>
  From that equation, we can then do some simulation. Let's assume you have a property in mind that
  costs 100000€, you are ready to spend no more than 600€ per months and the bank is asking for a 1%
  rate, how long would it take for you to pay back that loan? (we assume the rate does not depend
  on the loan term).
  </p>
  <p>
  First, we have to turn the amount owed to 0:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">0 = R<sup>n</sup>a(0) - m × (R<sup>n</sup> - 1) / (R - 1)</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    And to solve the equation with unknown <i>n</i>. For this, we will be using
    the logarithm function. <a class="visible-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2MIpDrF7Es">As you may know</a>,
    the logarithm of a power will decompose the radical and the power as two
    factors:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">log(a<sup>b</sup>) = b log(a)</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    We also get the following nice properties:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">log(ab)  = log(b) + log(a)</div>
    <div class="eqn">log(a/b) = log(b) - log(a)</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    So let <i>I = R - 1</i> then do some weird algebra gymnastic to isolate <i>n</i>:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">0 = R<sup>n</sup>a - m × (R<sup>n</sup> - 1) / I</div>
    <div class="eqn">0 = R<sup>n</sup>a - (R<sup>n</sup> - 1) × m / I</div>
    <div class="eqn">
    R<sup>n</sup>a - (R<sup>n</sup> - 1) × m / I
0 = ――――――――――――――――――――――
        1/I(m - aI)
    </div>
    <div class="eqn">
    R<sup>n</sup>aI - (R<sup>n</sup> - 1) × m
0 = ―――――――――――――――――――
         m - aI
    </div>
    <div class="eqn">
    R<sup>n</sup>aI - (R<sup>n</sup>m + m
0 = ――――――――――――――――
        m - aI
    </div>
    <div class="eqn">
    R<sup>n</sup>(aI - m) + m
0 = ――――――――――――――――
         m - aI
    </div>
    <div class="eqn">
    -R<sup>n</sup>(m - aI) + m
0 = ―――――――――――――――――――
         m - aI
    </div>
             m
    <div class="eqn">
0 = -R<sup>n</sup> + ――――――――
           m - aI
    </div>
    <div class="eqn">
         m
 R<sup>n</sup> = ――――――――
       m - aI
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
  So:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">R<sup>n</sup> = m/(m - a(R - 1))</div>
  </div>
  <p>
  With the logarithm:
  </p>
  <div class="eqns">
    <div class="eqn">nlog(R) = log(m) - log(m - a(R - 1))</div>
    <div class="eqn">n = [log(m) - log(m - a(R - 1))] / log(R)</div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If we plug <i>a=100000</i>, <i>m=600</i> and <i>R=(1 + 0.01 / 12)</i>, then we
    get a little more than 179 months (almost 15 years).
  </p>
  <h4>And so on...</h4>
  <p>
    You can manipulate that equation around to define different parameters as
    unknown, for example if you want to know how much you can borrow at a particular
    rate, with a predefined monthly payment on 20 years. It just requires a little
    bit of algebra.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best is to use a spreadsheet for that. Set the initial equation and use
    the "goal seek" function to find 0 by varying a cell or another depending
    on what you want to know.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's it! You are all set to become a real estate mogul, or at least a
    first time buyer... or remain a renter and watch price keep going up while
    playing around with your spreadsheet ! Fun !
