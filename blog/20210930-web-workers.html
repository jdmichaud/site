  <h3 class="title">What are Web Workers?</h3>
  <p>
    One of the particularities of Javascript in the browser is that its runtime
    is an event loop where your code is always executed in the main UI thread.
    This design allows to greatly simplify the front end code. You never need
    to worry about synchronizing access to resources as those resources are only
    accessed by one thread at the same time. Meanwhile, the event loop design
    allows to smoothly manage asynchonicity and keep your UI responsive even in
    the face of long running but low CPU tasks like fetching resources from a
    remote machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this design does not address the issue posed by long running high
    CPU tasks. As web applications become more complex, more tasks are offloaded
    to the browser and among those might be CPU intensive processing tasks
    related to image processing, encryption/decryption,
    compression/decompression, inference, etc. Implemented in Javascript, these
    tasks will be executed in the main thread blocking the UI, negatively
    impacting the user experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the C/C++ world, this problem would be solved through the use of threads.
    By dividing the attention of your CPU (either by multi-tasking or
    multi-threading) you will allow your long running tasks to execute without
    blocking you UI thread. Of course, the experience might be impacted if your
    CPU can't handle the load but this becomes a hardware issue not a software
    issue. By upgrading you system, your experience will improve.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the browser, there is a way to obtain a behavior similar to threads:
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API" class="visible-link">Web Workers.</a>
    The description on the MDN page says it all:
  </p>
  <q><i>
    Web Workers make it possible to run a script operation in a background
    thread separate from the main execution thread of a web application.
    The advantage of this is that laborious processing can be performed in a
    separate thread, allowing the main (usually the UI) thread to run without
    being blocked/slowed down.
  </i></q>
  <h3>An example</h3>
  <p>
    Here a simple example presenting how to use a web worker to execute a simple
    function that multiplies a number.
  <pre><code class="javascript">
var myWorker = new Worker('worker.js');
myWorker.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log('Event received from worker', event.data);
}
myWorker.postMessage(21);
  </code></pre>
  In a separate file called 'worker.js':
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log('Event received from main script', event);
  postMessage(event.data * 2);
}
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    There is a few things to unpack. First, you will notice the mode of
    communication between the main thread and the worker is through message
    passing. It might seem needlessly complex, why not work through
    simple asynchronous function calls by the way of Promises? The problem with
    promises is that you can resolve them only once. And
    <a href="/blog/blog-entry.html?article=20200522-observables.html" class="visible-link">Observables</a>
    are still not a thing in the browser so the way to allow for a worker to
    provide multiple responses during the task execution is through that
    messaging scheme.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another important point is the fact that the worker code has to live in a
    separate Javascript file. For people delivering encapsulated components, this
    might be a show-stopper or at least a pesky requirements to satisfy. Why not
    provide a function to be executed asynchronously. But worry not, there is a
    workaround to this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, and this is not apparent here, the execution context of the worker
    is slightly different from the execution context of the main thread.
    For example the `window` object is not available as well as the DOM. Of
    course, you are not executing in the UI thread so you can't change the UI.
    Except from this, you will have access to most of the browser's API.
  </p>

  <h3>A better interface</h3>
  <p>
    As we have seen, the Web Worker interface, though powerful can be a little
    awkward to use. Moreover, as any good gentle person these days, we fancy
    ourselves to be Typescript developers. Type safety is our creed. So we will
    try to address some of those points while reducing complexity and
    improving type safety.
  </p>
  <h4>Please take my function</h4>
  <p>
    My initial reaction to Web Workers was "why do I need to download an
    external script to use a Worker??". Indeed, in Javascript, functions are
    first class citizens. There are used everywhere. Why not provide a function
    to our worker? I don't pretend to know the rational of that design choice made
    by the standardization bodies of the Web ; My guess is that it would prevent
    developer to have the impression that the function can access closure from
    the Web Worker which is of course impossible. Isolating the worker code
    inside a separate script might make that clearer. Still, it's awkward...
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a solution to this though. The Worker's constructor expects a URL.
    In Javscript we can convert any function to a string using the toString method.
    Then through the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL" class="visible-link">createObjectURL</a>
    API we can convert any string to a URL. That's it:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
function createWorker(fun) {
  const funSerialized = `
    onmessage = async (msg) => {
      const result = await (${fun.toString()})(...msg.data);
      postMessage(result);
    };
  `
  const blob = new Blob([funSerialized], { type: 'application/javascript' });
  const worker = new Worker(URL.createObjectURL(blob));
}

const worker = createWorker((param) => param * 2);
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    This way we can now use functions directly with workers, no need of an
    external script. We just need to keep in mind that this function will be
    serialized and deserialized and will not be executed in place so the usual
    access to closure is not possible here. Note that we await the function so
    that you can either provide a synchronous or an asynchronous function to the
    worker factory. Awaiting on a synchronous function as no effect nor
    performance impact.
  </p>
  <h4>Another Typescript miracle !</h4>
  <p>
    In order to get some structure we will move that function in a specialized
    class which will be typed according to the type of the provided function to
    ensure type safety all the way.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="typescript">
export class ThreadBuilder&lt;OutputType, T extends any[]&gt; {
  static create&lt;OutputType, T extends any[]&gt;(code: (...args: T) => OutputType)
    : ThreadBuilder&lt;OutputType, T> {
    return new ThreadBuilder&lt;OutputType, T>(ThreadBuilder.makeServer(code));
  }

  private static makeServer&lt;OutputType, T extends any[]&gt;(code: (...args: T) => OutputType): string {
    return `
      onmessage = async (msg) => {
        const result = await (${code.toString()})(...msg.data);
        postMessage(result);
      };
    `;
  }

  private constructor(private readonly server: string) {}

  createThread(): Thread&lt;OutputType, T> {
    const blob = new Blob([this.server], { type: 'application/javascript' });
    const worker = new Worker(URL.createObjectURL(blob));
    return Thread.create(worker);
  }
}
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Nothing fancy. We just moved the code into a class and added a bunch of
    generics so the type checker has better clarity at what we are trying to do.
    Now we can just:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="typescript">
    const thread = ThreadBuilder.create((param) => param * 2).createThread();
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Note that we are not creating bare workers here. We are creating an instance
    of the class called Thread that we will describe below. The Thread class is
    just a wrapper around Worker so we can adjoin some types using generics.
    This way, the type checker can keep track of what that worker expects as
    parameters and what it will return.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="typescript">
  export class Thread&lt;OutputType, T extends any[]&gt; {
    static create&lt;OutputType, T extends any[]&gt;(worker: Worker): Thread&lt;OutputType, T> {
      return new Thread&lt;OutputType, T>(worker);
    }

    private constructor(private readonly worker: Worker) {}

    async run(...parameters: T): Promise&lt;OutputType> {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        this.worker.onmessage = function (msg: MessageEvent) {
          resolve(msg.data);
        };
        this.worker.onmessageerror = function (error: MessageEvent) {
          reject(error);
        };
        this.worker.postMessage(parameters);
      });
    }
  }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Thread will provide some abstraction over worker and represent the worker
    execution as a promise. It is important to not that we introduce a
    limitation in our design. The aforementioned ability of workers to deliver
    multiple messages as response to a call is now obstructed by the Promise
    abstraction. But that's ok. Every abstraction is a trade-off and this one
    seems acceptable. Should you need a particular worker to stream multiple
    responses then you can always create workers manually.
  </p>
  <p>
    Running the thread now is easy, just call the run method, provide your
    parameter(s) and await for the answer:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="typescript">
    const result = await ThreadBuilder.create((param) => param * 2).createThread().run(21);
    console.log(result); // 42
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Trying to retrieve the result into a string or passing an object
    instead of a number will generate a type error from your favorite typescript
    compiler. This will ease troubleshooting and increase your code quality.
  </p>
