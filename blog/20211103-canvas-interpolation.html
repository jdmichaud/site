    In some industries, displaying images with pixel perfect precision can be
    critical to quality. It might seem trivial to some, but in many ways,
    displaying pixel on a screen is still an exercise that remains to be
    mastered. There are many pitfalls but in this article we will focus on a
    little known fact that can be tricky to analyze and overcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the advantage of developing applications based on web technologies is
    the standardization of the environment you are working with. There are
    several vendors of web environments (also known as browsers) and they all
    have to respect a set of standards and rules that you can rely to be
    implemented consistently across platforms, whatever your OSes and whatever
    your hardware. It might be a little naive and such assumption might
    sometimes lead you to a false sense of security. But at least, you can rest
    assured that if a browser does not position your div properly, even though
    your code respects the HTML and CSS standards, then the browser is to be
    blamed.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, not everything can be specified and indeed, not everything is. One
    important aspect of displaying images on a discreet grid, that compose our
    screens, is interpolation. When you have to display an image which
    resolution does not perfectly match the resolution of the part of the screen
    you are drawing it to, some measure of interpolation must be applied.
    Unfortunately, how browser interpolate images is not entirely specified by
    the folks at the W3C.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, let's look at the <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/imageSmoothingEnabled"
    class="visible-link"><i>imageSmoothingEnabled</i></a> option of the canvas.
    It says that you can enable or disable image smoothing. Fine, but what is
    image smoothing? Some sort of interpolation indeed. But what sort? Is it
    nearest neighbor? Bilinear? Bicubic? Not specified. And this is only for the
    general algorithm used, so let's forget about the detail and corner cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    All this is to say that how browser interpolate images are implementation
    details. However, it can have a non negligible impact on how images are
    displayed. For example, let's take this image:
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/awesome-face.png" style="width: 256px; height: 256px"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>A 256x256 image.</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    This image is 256 pixels by 256 pixels and due to the limitation of this
    blogging platform we can't display it in a canvas, but if you were to try to
    display it this way:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  function main() {
    const canvas = document.getElementById('image');
    const context = canvas.getContext('2d');

    base_image = new Image();
    base_image.src = 'awesome-face.png';
    base_image.onload = function(){
      context.drawImage(base_image, 0.5, 0.5);
    }
  }

  window.onload = main;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;canvas id="image" width="257" height="257"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    You might be surprised at the result. Comparing the rendering of that code
    on firefox and chrome will show this:
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/awesome-face-diff.png" style="width: 50%"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>Difference between firefox and chrome rendering</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Indeed, here the image and the canvas sizes do not match. In order to have
    the image centered in the canvas we set the top left corner of the image
    window to (0.5, 0.5) which is perfectly reasonable. You will expect your
    environment to perform the necessary interpolation so that the image
    starting at half the top left pixel will lead to an appropriate result. And
    it does. The problem is "appropriate result" here is under specified. The
    interpolation is an implementation detail and both browser, at the time of
    this writing, interprets these specifications differently.
  </p>

  <h3>Closer look</h3>
  <p>
    In order to understand what is going on, let's try to do something simpler.
    We will print a black rectangle of size 2x2 to a canvas of size 2x2. Then
    we will "zoom" on that canvas to a 256x256 canvas. See the code
    <a href="https://gist.github.com/jdmichaud/cf151d46eb88bbffa53cecafb858009c" class="visible-link">here</a>.
    This will give you a canvas that display 4 blocks which are basically the 4
    pixels of your initial 2 by 2 canvas.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you can see, if we position that rectangle at the coordinate (0.5, 0.5),
    as we did with our awesome face earlier, the results in firefox and chrome
    are quite different.
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/awesome-interpolation-in-chrome.png" style="width: 50%"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>Interpolation in chrome</p></div>
  </div>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/awesome-interpolation-in-firefox.png" style="width: 50%"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>Interpolation in firefox</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If you are like me, you will find firefox interpolation more "correct". The
    top left pixel only is a quarter filled with black whereas the top right and
    bottom left are half filled and thus should be darker. But against the
    specifications, both representations are fine. Yet there are different. So a
    pixel perfect rendering, when interpolation is necessary, meaning every time
    the screen pixel grid does not exactly match the image grid, is impossible.
    And if you do not know that, it might hurt you.
