  <h3>How to debug WASM file in Firefox (you can't)</h3>
  <p>
    I have been playing around WebAssembly and as a Firefox user, I am a little
    frustrated by the lack of debug support for WASM file in this browser. Years
    ago, Chrome <a class="visible-link" href=https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasm-debugging-2020/>added the facility</a>
    to debug any WASM file the same way you would with any Javascript file. You
    can step through the code, inspect variables, etc. Firefox does not allow this.
    Probably because the only way to debug code in a browser, when the loaded code
    has been mangled (either by some uglifying process for JS or just by compilation
    for WASM), is through the use of <a class="visible-link" href=https://pvdz.ee/weblog/281>Source Maps</a>.
    But the way WASM binary files are produced today is not through some
    uglifying process but through the use of your usual compiler
    (C, C++, rust, zig, etc.). These compilers have had a way to encode debugging
    information long before source maps existed and this way is DWARF (well
    actually there are many historical formats for debugging purposes, a nice refresher
    <a class="visible-link" href=https://dwarfstd.org/doc/Debugging%20using%20DWARF-2012.pdf>can be found here</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    And so both worlds collide and you end up with Firefox not adapted to read
    these DWARF debug information and the impossibility to debug your WASM project
    in Firefox but through the use of good'ol "printfs" (or their browser
    equivalent). Printfs are good but sometime you want/need more. So I started to
    have a look at how the situation could be improved for Firefox.
  </p>
  <h4>A workaround</h4>
  <p>
    First, there is a tool called <a class="visible-link" href=https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/tools/wasm-sourcemap.py>wasm-sourcemap.py</a>.
    It's a python script that will read the output of another tool called
    <a class="visible-link" href=https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-dwarfdump.html>llvm-dwarfdump</a> and
    produce a source maps based on the DWARF data found in your WASM file. You use
    it this way:
  </p>
    <pre><code class="bash">
      $ llvm-dwarfdump -debug-info -debug-line --recurse-depth=0 myexecutable.wasm > dwarfdump.txt
      $ python3 wasm-sourcemap.py --dwarfdump-output dwarfdump.txt myexecutable.wasm --output myexecutable.wasm.sourcemap -u http://localhost:8000/main.wasm.sourcemap -w myexecutable2.wasm
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    What the script does is:
    <ul>
      <li>Parse the dwarfdump output and WASM executable (with DWARF symbol in it!)</li>
      <li>Write the sourcemap (in JSON format) into a output file called myexecutable.wasm.sourcemap</li>
      <li>Embed, in the WASM file itself (here renamed myexecutable2.wasm), the address to the source map generated for the browser to find.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column">
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img src="../assets/source-map-generation-process.svg" style="width: 50%;"></img></div>
    <div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><p style="font-size: 12px"><p>Extract DWARF and embed sourceMap.</p></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Of course, make sure you produced your executable with debug symbols.
    Otherwise, there'll be nothing to parse.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a couple of drawbacks from this approach. First, wasm-sourcemap, as
    found on the interweb, does not work. It was probably written before the
    Python3 schism and require some adjustements:
  </p>
    <pre><code class="diff">
  140,141c140,141
&lt;   section_name = "sourceMappingURL"
&lt;   section_content = encode_uint_var(len(section_name)) + section_name + encode_uint_var(len(url)) + url
---
&gt;   section_name = bytes("sourceMappingURL", "utf-8")
&gt;   section_content = encode_uint_var(len(section_name)) + section_name + encode_uint_var(len(url)) + bytes(url, "utf-8")
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    Then, as you can see in the command lines above, the URL has to be encoded as
    absolute to you server (here my localhost dev server). There is a workaround
    to this which is to store a relative URL in the WASM file, catch the WASM
    binary in the browser before calling <b>WebAssembly.instantiate</b>
    and rewrite the URL relative to <b>window.href.location</b> as
    <a class="visible-link" href=https://github.com/oasislabs/wasm-sourcemap>demonstrated here</a>.
  </p>
  <h4>Make your own path</h4>
  <p>
    All this is well and good but is a little involved. Wouldn't it be better
    to do this in one step IN the browser? No need for an additional build step
    and the use of a gazillions tools, more or less maintained? There is nothing
    preventing you from parsing the DWARF symbols directly in the browser from the
    WASM file before instantiating the module and embedding the source map, inline,
    right into the wasm buffer.
  </p>
  <p>
    But for this, we need to parse DWARF symbols! And how to we do that??
  </p>
  <h4>A quick WASM binary format intro</h4>
  <p>
    First, let's have a look at the WASM binary format
    <a class="visible-link" href=https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/intro/index.html>formally described here</a>.
    As you can see this document (at least at the time of writing this article)
    is, shall we say, abstruse. And for a <a class="visible-link" href=https://grugbrain.dev/>grub brained developer</a>
    like us (at least like me) it requires some finessing. So looking at some
    vulgarising blog <a class="visible-link" href=https://coinexsmartchain.medium.com/wasm-introduction-part-1-binary-format-57895d851580>here</a>
    and <a class="visible-link" href=https://blog.ttulka.com/learning-webassembly-2-wasm-binary-format>there</a>
    we can find out that the WASM format is more or less built this way:
    <pre><code>
      0061 736d 0100 0000 0105 ....
    </code></pre>
    The first four bytes will contain a magic word: 0x00 (\0) 0x61 (a) 0x73 (s) 0x6d (m).
    So in full: <b>\0asm</b>. Then will come the WASM version on four bytes: 0x01000000.
    No, this is not WASM version 64. WASM binary files are
    <a class="visible-link" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#/media/File:Little-Endian.svg>little endian</a>.
    It means you start to read the little end of the word first, so the starting
    0x01 get at the end of the word: 0x00000001: WASM Version 1. The one and
    only WASM version as the time of writing this article.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then you start getting to the meat of the WASM file: <a class="visible-link" href=https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/modules.html>the sections</a>.
    The WASM binary is a succession of sections each with a type and a size. The
    type tells you what the section contain and the size tells you the amount of
    bytes it occupies in the file. Here, the section starts right after the WASM
    version indicated by the cursor:
    <pre><code>
      0061 736d 0100 0000 0105 XXXX XXXX XX
                          ^
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    The type is a value from 0 to 11 and is stored on 1 byte. Type 0 are custom
    sections and from 1 to 11 you have "WASM" sections.
    After the section comes its size as a unsigned <a class="visible-link" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128>LEB128 integer</a>.
    LEB128 is a format used to store arbitrary size integer. Refer to the provided
    Wikipedia page to know how to decode that LEB128 integer.
  </p>
  <p>
    So here we have a section of type 1 stored in 5 bytes. The size does not take the
    type and the size into account, so only the XXs are counted. If you
    wanted to skip that section, once your position in the buffer is right after
    the size you just read, add the size and you will point at the byte in the
    buffer that corresponds to the next section type id (or the end of the file).
    <pre><code>
      0061 736d 0100 0000 0105 XXXX XXXX XX01 ....
                               . -- +5 --> ^
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <h4>DWARF sections</h4>
  <p>
    Earlier I mentionned that we are going to ignore the WASM sections and focus
    on the custom sections. That's because this is where the DWARF sections live.
    DWARF is not defined by the WASM specs. DWARF pre-dates WASM and could be found,
    up to now, first in ELF executables. How can we recognized DWARF section then?
  </p>
  <p>
    Within the WASM custom section (those with Type ID 0), we will find the name
    of the section:
  </p>
    <pre><code>
      .. .. 00 8D 0B  0B 2E 64 65  62 75 67 5F  69 6E 66 6F
    </code></pre>
  <p>
    This is an example of a DWARF <b>.debug_info</b> section embedded in a WASM
    file. The first byte is 0x00 indicating a custom section. Then 0x8D and 0xBD
    indicates the size of this custom section (here 0x0B8D (LEB128) -> 0x058D (uint16))
    and then we get another unsigned LEB128 size: 0x0B. This is the size of the
    name of the section. It says that the next 0x0B (11) bytes are ascii
    characters:
    <pre><code class="diff">
    0x2E -> .
    0x64 -> d
    0x65 -> e
    0x62 -> b
    0x75 -> u
    0x67 -> g
    0x5F -> _
    0x69 -> i
    0x6E -> n
    0x66 -> f
    0x6F -> o
    </code></pre>
    This section is named <b>.debug_info</b>. And this is a DWARF section! You
    <a class="visible-link" href=https://gist.github.com/jdmichaud/7fb81e46a97b0bd47fcaca649ad969ce#file-dump_wasm_sections-js>can find here some Javascript code</a>
    usable in <b>node</b> that put all this in practice to dump information on
    your WASM executable sections.
  </p>
  <h4>Next time</h4>
  <p>
    In our next article, I will describe in more detail how DWARF sections are
    organized and how we extract information from them to generate our sourcemap.
